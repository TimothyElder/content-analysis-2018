        <p>One quadrillion synapses are laid in the first two years of postnatal construction of the human brain, which are then pruned until age 10 to 500 trillion synapses composing the final network. Genetic epilepsies are the most common neurological diseases with onset during pruning, affecting 0.5% of 2–10-year-old children, and these epilepsies are often characterized by spontaneous remission. We previously described a remitting epilepsy in the <italic>Lagotto romagnolo</italic> canine breed. Here, we identify the gene defect and affected neurochemical pathway. We reconstructed a large <italic>Lagotto</italic> pedigree of around 34 affected animals. Using genome-wide association in 11 discordant sib-pairs from this pedigree, we mapped the disease locus to a 1.7 Mb region of homozygosity in chromosome 3 where we identified a protein-truncating mutation in the <italic>Lgi2</italic> gene, a homologue of the human epilepsy gene <italic>LGI1</italic>. We show that LGI2, like LGI1, is neuronally secreted and acts on metalloproteinase-lacking members of the ADAM family of neuronal receptors, which function in synapse remodeling, and that LGI2 truncation, like LGI1 truncations, prevents secretion and ADAM interaction. The resulting epilepsy onsets at  around seven weeks (equivalent to human two years), and remits by four months (human eight years), versus onset after age eight in the majority of human patients with LGI1 mutations. Finally, we show that <italic>Lgi2</italic> is expressed highly in the immediate post-natal period until halfway through pruning, unlike <italic>Lgi1</italic>, which is expressed in the latter part of pruning and beyond. LGI2 acts at least in part through the same ADAM receptors as LGI1, but earlier, ensuring electrical stability (absence of epilepsy) during pruning years, preceding this same function performed by LGI1 in later years. <italic>LGI2</italic> should be considered a candidate gene for common remitting childhood epilepsies, and LGI2-to-LGI1 transition for mechanisms of childhood epilepsy remission.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Major remodeling of the neuronal synaptic network occurs during childhood. The quadrillion synapses formed till the end of age two are trimmed to 500 trillion by age 10 through a selective process of strengthening of ideal connections, removal of redundant ones, and formation of new contacts. Very little is known about the basic mechanisms that direct this massive reorganization that leads to the adult brain. The most common epilepsies of humans occur in childhood and are characterized by remission prior to adulthood. Not much is known about their genetics and basic remission mechanisms. We describe here a canine equivalent disease and identify the defective gene, Lgi2. We show that the gene product is a secreted protein and interacts with neuronal ADAM receptors known to be involved in the regulation of synaptic remodeling in the developing brain. Our work sheds important light on the basic mechanisms of the most common neurological disease of children and discloses processes of epilepsy remission. The identification of the first focal epilepsy gene in dogs has also enabled the development of a genetic test to identify carriers for breeding purposes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Postnatal mammalian brain development proceeds in three phases the first of which is construction of the primary neural network (ages zero to two years in humans, zero to one week in mice, and estimated zero to one to two months in dogs). In humans, this phase generates a network of approximately one quadrillion synapses. The second phase, pruning (ages two to 10 years in humans, seven to 17 days in mice, and estimated two to four months in dogs), is chiefly characterized by massive removal of unneeded or otherwise inappropriate synapses, almost half the original synapses. The third and final phase is the remainder of life, during which synapse numbers remain stable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Arsenault1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Watson1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Epilepsies are by far the most common neurological diseases in children two to 10 years of age, the three most common of which are Rolandic Epilepsy, Panayiotopoulos syndrome, and Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE). The first two of these three syndromes are focal-onset epilepsies where seizures start from defined brain regions, while CAE is a generalized epilepsy where seizures appear to start simultaneously from all brain regions. All three syndromes share a remarkable feature of remission after age 10, i.e. after network pruning is complete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Roger1">[4]</xref>. All three are genetically complex syndromes, and paucity of gene information has impeded their understanding, including how and why they remit. To date, a few ion channel mutations (e.g. in <italic>GABRG2, CACNA1H</italic>) have been found in CAE, accounting for far less than 1% of patients with this syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Turnbull1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While the above three syndromes begin and end during the pruning phase of neurodevelopment in the vast majority of cases, other genetic epilepsies begin near or after the end of this phase, i.e. after age eight in most cases. These include the generalized Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME) (to date with mutations in the <italic>EFHC1</italic> or <italic>GABRA1</italic> genes; penetrance ∼50%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Suzuki1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Cossette1">[7]</xref> and the focal-onset Autosomal Dominant Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (ADLTE) (also called Autosomal Dominant Partial Epilepsy with Auditory Features) with mutations in the <italic>LGI1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Kalachikov1">[8]</xref> (penetrance 67%) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Rosanoff1">[9]</xref>. JME is generally a non-remitting lifelong epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Medina1">[10]</xref>. Remission rate in ADLTE has not been determined, although the literature indicates that most cases remain on seizure medications, unlike Rolandic epilepsy, e.g., where the vast majority do not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Medina1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Nobile1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the present work, we show that mutation of the <italic>Lgi2</italic> gene, a gene closely related to <italic>Lgi1</italic>, causes remitting focal-onset epilepsy in dogs between ages one and four months, which is equivalent to human two to eight years. LGI2 belongs to a family of four closely related neuronal proteins including the well-studied LGI1. We report functional and expression studies of LGI2, which, combined with previous LGI1 studies, suggest a novel concept of the basis of remission common in childhood epilepsy.</p>

        <title>Focal-onset epilepsy in the <italic>Lagotto Romagnolo</italic> canine breed is associated with a truncating mutation of the <italic>Lgi2</italic> gene</title>
        <p>The <italic>Lagotto Romagnolo</italic> is an ancient curly-haired water dog (water dogs, or water spaniels, originally served to retrieve game falling in water), which was selected in Italy to become an excellent truffle hunter. The popularity of the breed fluctuated with the truffle industry and in the early 1970s underwent a strong genetic bottleneck to near extinction, when a group of dog lovers decided to save it. The breed has since gained popularity for reasons unrelated to truffle or water hunting, and its numbers are in the thousands spread across most developed countries (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lagottoromagnolo.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.lagottoromagnolo.org/</ext-link>).</p>
        <p>The breed is affected by an epilepsy, Benign Familial Juvenile Epilepsy (BFJE), described in detail in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Jokinen1">[12]</xref>. Onset is at five to nine weeks of age, and the epilepsy invariably completely remits by four months of age. Remission is so reliable that the epilepsy is considered by many breeders as an unfortunate particularity of the breed and often disregarded. The seizures consist of whole-body tremors sometimes associated with alteration of consciousness. Electroencephalography (EEG) reveals unilateral epileptic discharges in central-parietal and occipital lobes, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is normal. During the months with epilepsy the animals are often ataxic, but this resolves completely as the seizures disappear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Jokinen1">[12]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Towards the goal of mapping and identifying the BFJE gene we first reconstructed a large multinational <italic>Lagotto</italic> pedigree from which an example with 212 Finnish dogs including 34 cases is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002194.s001">Figure S1</xref>. The dogs live in homes as private pets, often in different countries in Europe, or were still with their breeders. Disease segregation suggested autosomal recessive inheritance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002194.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Next, we performed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genome-wide association study with DNA from 11 of the affected dogs and 11 unaffected littermates (discordant sib-pairs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002194.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and found very strong association in a region of chromosome 3 (CFA3), peaking at the marker at base-pair 89159216 (P<sub>raw</sub> 0.000035; P<sub>genomewide</sub> 0.08) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002194-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). There was no significant association at any other genomic locus, the next best association being over 100-fold less significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002194-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Genotype analysis around the 89159216 SNP revealed a 1.7 Mb block of homozygous SNPs between markers at 87.3 Mb and 89.0 Mb in the 11 cases and none of the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002194-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This region contains nine genes, including <italic>Lgi2</italic>. Sequencing <italic>Lgi2</italic> revealed an exonic homozygous protein-truncating sequence change, c.1552A&gt;T (p.K518X), in all 11 affected and none of the 11 unaffected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002194-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Genotyping a cohort of 140 dogs for the 89159216 SNP, for the <italic>Lgi2</italic> c.1552 sequence change, and for three additional SNPs from the homozygous region revealed extremely high associations including P<sub>raw</sub> 4.47×10<sup>−16</sup> at 89159216 and P<sub>raw</sub> 1.05×10<sup>−23</sup> (the highest association) at <italic>Lgi2</italic> c.1552 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1002194-t001">Table 1</xref>). These results strongly suggested that <italic>Lgi2</italic> c.1552A&gt;T (p.K518X) is the BFJE mutation.</p>

        <p>Next we studied segregation of the sequence change in the pedigree. Of the 28 affected dogs from which we had samples, 26 (93%) were homozygous <italic>Lgi2</italic> c.1552T (p.518X) (i.e. homozygous for the nonsense codon), two were heterozygous (7%), and none was homozygous for the wild-type (wt) A nucleotide. The two affected dogs that were heterozygous were also heterozygous for the 13 SNP haplotype around the <italic>Lgi2</italic> locus, and we found no evidence for compound heterozygosity as all other variants in the gene were synonymous (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002194.s004">Table S1</xref>). These results suggested that if the <italic>Lgi2</italic> c.1552A&gt;T (p.K518X) change is the BFJE mutation, it can, in a minority of cases, cause the epilepsy heterozygously. To explore this further, we screened an independent set of 36 sporadic <italic>Lagottos</italic> and found three homozygous for c.1552T, 14 heterozygous (39%), and 19 wild-type (wt). All three dogs homozygous for c.1552T had the syndrome, as did one of the carriers (7%), appearing to confirm the 7% rate of disease through heterozygosity, assuming that <italic>Lgi2</italic> c.1552A&gt;T (p.K518X) is causative.</p>
        <p>Among 112 unaffecteds of the genotyped 140 dogs, 69 were homozygous for the wt A nucleotide, 41 were heterozygous, and two, 1.8%, were homozygous for c.1552T (OR = 532, 95%CI: 95.0-5747.1 and p = 1.05×10<sup>−23</sup>). The latter two may be mis-specified as unaffected - clinical information on many of the dogs in the pedigree was obtained through retrospective questionnaires, and it is possible that a breeder missed seizures, as the epilepsy in some cases is mild and short-lived <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Huttenlocher1">[2]</xref>. Alternatively, these two cases may represent incomplete penetrance, assuming, again, that the sequence change we identified is causative. Similarly, other recent recessive gene discoveries indicate incomplete penetrance including canine lens luxation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Farias1">[13]</xref>, degenerative myoelopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Awano1">[14]</xref> and a form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Abitbol1">[15]</xref>.</p>
        <p>At this point, there were two possibilities. Either <italic>Lgi2</italic> c.1552A&gt;T (p.K518X) is the BFJE mutation with an incomplete penetrance in a minority of cases, or it is not the causative variant. To gather more data we proceeded with functional studies of the consequences of the truncating sequence change on the LGI2 protein.</p>

        <p>LGI2 belongs to a family of neuronally secreted proteins (LGI1 to LGI4) conserved across mammals and composed of N-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRR) and C-termini containing seven EPTP repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Watson1">[3]</xref>. K518X truncates LGI2 within the seventh EPTP repeat (exon 8 of the gene) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002194.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Similar mutations truncating LGI1 in the EPTP repeats in humans, including in the seventh repeat, cause ADLTE, the human epilepsy with most commonly onset after age eight and persistence through adulthood. Where studied, the vast majority of LGI1 mutations, truncating or otherwise, prevent secretion of the protein encoded by the mutant allele, and ADLTE is therefore usually a disease due to lack of neuronal secretion of half the required amount of LGI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Nobile1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Berkovic1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Senechal1">[17]</xref>.

To determine whether LGI2 also binds ADAM22, ADAM23 and ADAM11 following secretion, we performed immunofluorescent cell surface-binding assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Fukata1">[18]</xref> in permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells by co-expressing wt or truncated LGI2 with different ADAMs. Wt LGI2 was secreted and then bound ADAM22, ADAM23 and ADAM11 expressed on the cell surface (ADAM11 result not shown). Truncated LGI2 was not secreted and did not bind the ADAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002194-g004">Figure 4A–4B</xref>).

        <p>Summarizing the results to this point, the genome-wide association study revealed a highly significant association in the vicinity of <italic>Lgi2</italic>, an extremely strong association (p = 1.05×10<sup>−23</sup>) with the protein-truncating c.1552A&gt;T (p.K518X) sequence change in the gene, and no significant association with any other locus. <italic>Lgi2</italic> is a close homologue of the epilepsy (ADLTE) gene <italic>LGI1</italic>, and the <italic>Lgi2</italic> truncating mutation is closely similar to the most common type of epilepsy-causing mutations in <italic>LGI1</italic>. The consequence of the truncation on Lgi2 is identical to the consequence of truncation on LGI1, prevention of neuronal secretion and binding to ADAM receptors, which is presently the most favored mechanism of epileptogenesis in ADLTE. Finally, <italic>LGI1</italic> mutations, including truncation mutations, are non-penetrant in 33% of individuals, compared to 1.8% non-penetrance in the case of the canine <italic>Lgi2</italic> truncation. Considering all the above, we believe the data meet the burden of proof that <italic>Lgi2</italic> c.1552A&gt;T (p.K518X) is the BFJE mutation. BFJE is transmitted in imperfect Mendelian fashion. In the vast majority of cases, 93%, homozygous mutation is required for the disease to manifest. In a minority, 7%, heterozygosity suffices. Conversely, 1.8% of dogs may be resistant to seizing despite homozygous mutation. Finally, we found no dog with homozygous wt genotype at <italic>Lgi2</italic> c.1552 that has BFJE.</p>

We next chased <italic>Lgi2</italic> expression levels in mouse forebrain and cerebellum by performing quantitative RT-PCR every other day from birth till 27 days. <italic>Lgi2</italic> expression in the cerebellum did not change appreciably over this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002194-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Expression in the forebrain, on the other hand, was highest at birth and through phase one of postnatal development (neural network construction phase), and declined to half the original amount by midway through the pruning phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1002194-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Considering that BFJE occurs only during the pruning phase, these results suggest that LGI2's main functions take place in the developmental phase preceding the phase in which the epilepsy occurs.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Epilepsy is a common symptom of insult to the brain from various causes including tumors, trauma, stroke, and neurodegenerative disease. For example, the most common cause of epilepsy in the elderly is stroke and in neonates hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. However, epilepsy can also be a disease onto itself, where seizures are the only or preponderant neurological symptom, i.e. the brain is normal except for its propensity to seize. Resolving the basic mechanisms of this type of ‘pure’ epilepsy is expected to provide the clearest insights into epileptogenesis. As mentioned, these pure epilepsy syndromes (sometimes called idiopathic, Greek for ‘disease onto itself’) are the commonest neurological diseases with onset in two to 10 year-old children, and in this age group most are genetic, commonly polygenic, and often characterized by remission in adolescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Turnbull1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Genetic-idiopathic epilepsy syndromes are the most common neurological diseases of dogs, in some breeds 10 times more common than in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Berendt1">[23]</xref>. In the present work we identify the first of the canine idiopathic epilepsy genes, in a remitting syndrome with onset and offset equivalent to human childhood two to 10 years. This epilepsy can now be eliminated from the <italic>Lagotto</italic> through selective breeding. Carrier frequency of the mutation is very high. We tested 576 <italic>Lagottos</italic> from three different countries and found a carrier rate of 32% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002194.s005">Table S2</xref>). On the other hand, the mutation appears restricted to this particular epilepsy in this particular breed. We tested 121 epileptic dogs from 40 different breeds, including Barbets, a <italic>Lagotto</italic>-related French water spaniel breed afflicted with a separate epilepsy, and none carries the BFJE mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002194.s006">Table S3</xref>).</p>
      <p>Genetic epilepsies of various types, as simple or complex traits, are highly enriched in various canine breeds, including Miniature Wirehaired Dacshunds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Lohi1">[24]</xref>, Finnish Spitzs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Jeserevics1">[25]</xref> and Belgian Shepherds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Berendt1">[23]</xref> due to pure-breeding. Each of these traits is in genetic isolation within its corresponding breed. This vastly improves signal to noise ratio in genetic studies compared to human populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Wilbe1">[26]</xref>, which should facilitate mapping epilepsy genes. The <italic>Lagotto</italic> themselves segregate a second epilepsy with onset in adulthood completely distinct from BFJE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Jokinen1">[12]</xref>. We have established that this second epilepsy is not associated with the BFJE mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1002194.s004">Table S1</xref>), and are presently mapping its gene(s). Five out of the six adult-onset cases with persistent seizures in our pedigree were genotyped and only one of them was homozygous for the BFJE mutation. However, the puppyhood history of this case is unknown and it was impossible to confirm retrospectively whether this case has also had BFJE. This case has an affected littermate with classical BFJE who is homozygous for the mutation. On the other hand, all the other genotyped adult-onset dogs were wildtypes strongly suggesting that this form of epilepsy has its own genetic cause, and that this single homozygous case may have suffered from both BFJE and the adult-onset form of epilepsy.</p>
      <p>The BFJE gene is a homolog of the human epilepsy gene <italic>LGI1</italic>. LGI1 is neuronally secreted and binds three metalloproteinase-lacking ADAM receptors. Significant progress has started to be made in elucidating LGI1's functions at these receptors. LGI1 interaction with post-synaptic ADAM22 strengthens and stabilizes ADAM22-containing synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Fukata1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Zhou1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Fukata2">[22]</xref>. Interaction with pre-synaptic ADAM23 enhances neurite outgrowth from ADAM23-containing axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Owuor1">[27]</xref>. Through its seven-bladed β-propeller structure (encoded by the EPTP repeats), LGI1 simultaneously binds ADAM23 and ADAM22, pulling pre and post-synaptic membranes together, physically stabilizing synapses containing these two proteins and strengthening neurotransmission in these synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Fukata2">[22]</xref>. Importantly, LGI1 regulates neuronal terminal pruning and maturation, again through a combined pre and post-synaptic action <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Zhou1">[21]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Humans not expressing or secreting LGI1 from one allele develop epilepsy starting in the vast majority of cases after age eight and seeming to persist in adulthood in many cases. Mice completely lacking LGI1 are normal until midway through the pruning phase of brain development (∼P13), when LGI1 would normally have started being expressed, after which they develop seizures that progressively worsen as LGI1's amounts would normally have progressively increased, and die of violent convulsions by four weeks of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Fukata2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Chabrol1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Yu1">[29]</xref>. These results show that LGI1 is a vital protein, vital specifically in protecting the brain against seizures. In humans its partial loss results in epilepsy, and only epilepsy, and in the mice its complete loss leads to death from epilepsy prior to the presence of any other neurological symptom. This vital anti-epileptic role is mediated at least in part through the above three ADAM receptors suggesting that the LGI1-ADAM complexes and their related pathways are essential components of neural network electrical stability in the maturing and mature brain.</p>
      <p>We show in our study that lack of secretion of LGI2 is also associated with epilepsy, at an earlier stage of development, and secreted LGI2 interacts with the same ADAM receptors as LGI1, suggesting that LGI2 participates in protecting the brain against seizures during the pruning phase of neurodevelopment at least in part through the same system utilized by LGI1 in the subsequent phase. Importantly, LGI2 expression is highest in the phase preceding pruning and epilepsy. This suggests that the LGI2 anti-epileptic activity anticipates the pruning phase, i.e. LGI2 acts during the network construction phase to help prepare a network that will not seize during the pruning phase. To date, there has been no compelling evidence-based theory of why so many epilepsies of childhood begin and end with the start and end of the pruning phase. Our results, combined with the body of LGI1 work, suggest the following. Construction of the initial network includes mechanisms, in which LGI2 participates, that ensure that the network will not seize during the pruning phase. Defects in these anticipatory anti-epileptic processes result in epilepsy as the massive changes of the pruning phase commence. The pruning phase itself encompasses mechanisms, in which LGI1 participates, that ensure that the pruned and remodeled network to serve the rest of the animal's life is electrically stable. These mechanisms are able to correct or compensate for earlier instabilities, e.g. those introduced by LGI2 deficiency, resulting in the remission that characterizes so many childhood idiopathic epilepsies.</p>
      <p>Of the remaining two LGI proteins, LGI4 appears not to have a major role in the central nervous system. Instead, its chief function appears to be in regulating neuron-Schwann cell interaction, its secretion defect resulting in inability of Schwann cells to correctly myelinate peripheral nerves, resulting in peripheral nervous system hypomyelination and the murine claw-paw phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Bermingham1">[30]</xref>. LGI3's function, on the other hand, appears to be similar to that of LGI1, as there is evidence that like LGI1 it regulates neurite outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Park1">[31]</xref>. LGI3 starts being expressed at p7 in mouse, i.e. at the very start of the pruning phase, has steady and high expression throughout the brain in adulthood, and interacts with ADAM22 and ADAM23, as well as presynaptic SNARE complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Park1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Park2">[34]</xref>. However, LGI3 does not rescue the LGI1 knockout mouse epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Fukata2">[22]</xref>, and therefore the two proteins are at least not interchangeable.</p>
      <p>Four phenotypes have been associated with LGI1. The first is normalcy in the up to 33% of patients with heterozygous mutations in ADLTE families. Second is ADLTE in the remaining patients with heterozygous <italic>LGI1</italic> mutations. The third is the recent realization that the acquired autoimmune epilepsy syndrome Limbic Encephalitis, long thought to be due to auto-antibodies against a potassium channel, is in fact due to an auto-antibody against LGI1. As expected, all patients with this condition are over 10 years of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1002194-Lai1">[35]</xref>. The final phenotype is the intractable and fatal mid-pruning phase-onset murine epilepsy caused by complete LGI1 deficiency. In the clinic, we not infrequently encounter previously normal children with onset of explosive catastrophic epilepsy. Homozygous mutations in <italic>LGI1</italic> (and possibly <italic>LGI3</italic>) should be considered as a possible cause of this presentation.</p>
      <p>The phenotype associated with LGI2 in the present study is of a remitting epilepsy with focal onset and centrotemporal and occipital spikes on EEG, occurring within the age range equivalent to human two to 10 years. Two of the most common human epilepsy syndromes occur in this age range, Rolandic Epilepsy, which is focal in onset with centrotemporal spikes on EEG, and Panayiotopoulos Syndrome, again focal-onset, with both centrotemporal and occipital spikes on EEG. <italic>LGI2</italic> should be considered a candidate gene in these common epilepsies.</p>
