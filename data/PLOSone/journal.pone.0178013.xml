<abstract>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) initiates a deleterious inflammatory response that exacerbates pathology and worsens outcome. This inflammatory response is partially mediated by a reduction in cAMP and a concomitant upregulation of cAMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterases (PDEs) acutely after TBI. The PDE4B subfamily, specifically PDE4B2, has been found to regulate cAMP in inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, macrophages and microglia. To determine if PDE4B regulates inflammation and subsequent pathology after TBI, adult male Sprague Dawley rats received sham surgery or moderate parasagittal fluid-percussion brain injury (2 ± 0.2 atm) and were then treated with a PDE4B - selective inhibitor, A33, or vehicle for up to 3 days post-surgery. Treatment with A33 reduced markers of microglial activation and neutrophil infiltration at 3 and 24 hrs after TBI, respectively. A33 treatment also reduced cortical contusion volume at 3 days post-injury. To determine whether this treatment paradigm attenuated TBI-induced behavioral deficits, animals were evaluated over a period of 6 weeks after surgery for forelimb placement asymmetry, contextual fear conditioning, water maze performance and spatial working memory. A33 treatment significantly improved contextual fear conditioning and water maze retention at 24 hrs post-training. However, this treatment did not rescue sensorimotor or working memory deficits. At 2 months after surgery, atrophy and neuronal loss were measured. A33 treatment significantly reduced neuronal loss in the pericontusional cortex and hippocampal CA3 region. This treatment paradigm also reduced cortical, but not hippocampal, atrophy. Overall, these results suggest that acute PDE4B inhibition may be a viable treatment to reduce inflammation, pathology and memory deficits after TBI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Every year approximately 1.7 million people suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref001">1</xref>]. This is a serious clinical problem that results in an estimated 3–5.3 million people living with lasting TBI-related disabilities, at a total cost of approximately $60 billion dollars annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref003">3</xref>]. A majority of TBI survivors go on to develop cognitive impairments, often resulting in reduced quality of life and increased economic burden for the individual and their family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref008">8</xref>]. Treatments aimed at reducing inflammation and, consequently, the extent of damage after TBI are a potential strategy for attenuating these cognitive impairments. In experimental models of CNS injury, elevating cAMP levels through inhibition of cAMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is an effective strategy for reducing inflammation and improving outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref009">9</xref>]. Development of an inhibitor to target selective PDE isoforms involved in inflammation after TBI would greatly facilitate clinical development.</p>
<p>The anti-inflammatory benefits of increasing cAMP levels are well documented in experimental models of TBI, spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral ischemia and multiple sclerosis (MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref013">13</xref>]. Of the 11 identified PDE families, PDE4, PDE7 and PDE8 are specific for cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref014">14</xref>]. In the context of inflammation and CNS injury, PDE4 is one of the more extensively studied cAMP-specific PDEs and is a major cAMP-hydrolyzing enzyme in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref018">18</xref>]. The PDE4 superfamily consists of 4 subfamilies: PDE4A, 4B, 4C and 4D. Each subfamily is encoded by a single gene, and there are multiple isoforms within each subfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref019">19</xref>]. Pan-PDE4 inhibitors, such as rolipram, have been used to reduce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels and neutrophil accumulation in models of systemic inflammation and CNS injury, such as SCI, cerebral ischemia and TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref020">20</xref>]. Previously, we reported that pre-injury treatment with rolipram rescued cAMP signaling deficits and reduced inflammation after TBI, as measured by a decrease in TNF and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref012">12</xref>]. When administered after TBI, rolipram reproduced the anti-inflammatory benefits observed with pre-injury treatment, but also resulted in increased hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref022">22</xref>]. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory benefits of acute pan-PDE4 inhibition are overshadowed by vascular perturbations after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref022">22</xref>]. Altogether, the hemorrhagic and emetic effects observed with pan-PDE4 inhibitors underscores the need for more refined approaches for targeting PDE4 subfamilies to reduce inflammation and improve recovery after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>The development of PDE4 subfamily knockout mice has further clarified the functions of each of these subfamilies. One of the major findings is the role of the PDE4B subfamily in regulating inflammatory signaling. Specifically, PDE4B has been shown to regulate TNF production and neutrophil recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref026">26</xref>]. After TBI, neutrophils are the first immune cell population to infiltrate the injured brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref027">27</xref>]. Neutrophils are found in the brain within a few hours after trauma, and peak accumulation occurs around 24 hrs after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref029">29</xref>]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that neutrophil accumulation is associated with poor histopathological and behavioral outcome after TBI, and treatments aimed at reducing neutrophil accumulation attenuate these TBI-induced pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref033">33</xref>]. These studies suggest that treatments for reducing neutrophil accumulation, such as PDE4B inhibition, are potential therapeutics for attenuating inflammation and improving outcome after TBI.</p>
<p>In addition to regulating neutrophil recruitment, several studies have demonstrated that augmenting cAMP signaling leads to an upregulation of anti-inflammatory markers, such as Arginase 1 (Arg1), in macrophages and microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref038">38</xref>]. Arg1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are competitive enzymes, and the dichotomous relationship between iNOS and Arg1 in regulating L-arginine metabolism and inflammation has led to the use of these enzymes as pro—and anti-inflammatory markers, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref041">41</xref>]. However, whether the PDE4B subfamily is responsible for modulating cAMP signaling in iNOS or Arg1-producing pathways in inflammatory cells after TBI is unknown.</p>
<p>The PDE4B subfamily consists of 5 known isoforms, PDE4B1–5. In the context of inflammation, the PDE4B2 isoform is of particular importance due to its regulation by inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and TNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref043">43</xref>]. Furthermore, increased expression of PDE4B2 has been associated with a pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages, microglia and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref044">44</xref>]. Increased PDE4B2 expression has also been reported in experimental models of SCI, MS and TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref046">46</xref>]. Altogether, these findings suggest a potential role for PDE4B2 in regulating the inflammatory response in multiple CNS injury and disease models, including TBI.</p>
<p>The PDE4B-specific inhibitor, A33, has made it possible to study the therapeutic benefits of targeting PDE4B in a variety of neurological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref048">48</xref>]. A33 has a half-life of approximately 3.8–4.5 hrs in the mouse brain, and is over 50-fold more selective for PDE4B (IC<sub>50</sub> = 27 nM) over PDE4D (IC<sub>50</sub> = 1569 nM) and other PDEs (IC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 10μM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref050">50</xref>]. This selectivity is due to a single amino acid polymorphism in the C-terminus of PDE4B, termed CR3 (Control Region 3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref051">51</xref>]. CR3 is conserved in all PDE4B isoforms and co-crystal structure studies have revealed that A33 inhibits PDE4B by promoting a closed conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref051">51</xref>]. The A33-mediated inactive conformation is due to CR3 closing over the active site of PDE4B and preventing access to cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref051">51</xref>]. Overall, the improved specificity of A33 over available pan-PDE4 inhibitors that access the CNS, such as rolipram, makes it an important reference compound for evaluating the anti-inflammatory effects of PDE4B inhibition.</p>
<p>The connection between inflammation and cAMP signaling has been extensively studied in multiple models of CNS injury and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref052">52</xref>]. However, lack of subtype-selective PDE4 inhibitors has hampered the development of this therapeutic approach for TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref022">22</xref>]. In this study, we characterized the effect of a PDE4B-selective inhibitor, A33, on inflammation, pathology and behavioral deficits after TBI. We report that treatment with A33 reduced neutrophil accumulation, microglia activation, cortical contusion volume, memory deficits, neuronal loss and cortical atrophy after TBI. These results support the use of PDE4B-selective inhibitors as a treatment for TBI.</p>

<title>Surgery</title>
<p>All experimental procedures were in compliance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the University of Miami Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC protocol number: 17–004). Prior to surgery, animals were randomized to receive sham or TBI surgery, and treatment with A33 or vehicle. To determine the minimum number of animals needed for each experiment, a power analysis was performed to detect a 20% difference between treatment groups with power set at 80% and significance at 0.05. A minimum n value of 3 for biochemical studies and 10 for behavioral measures was determined. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (2–3 months old, Charles River Laboratories) were anesthetized (3% isoflurane, 70% N<sub>2</sub>O, 30% O<sub>2</sub>) and received a 4.8 mm diameter craniotomy at 3.8 mm posterior to bregma and 2.5 mm lateral to midline over the right parietal cortex. A plastic luer lock adapter was fastened at the craniotomy site with cyanoacrylate and dental cement. Animals were fasted overnight (12–16 hrs) with water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Animals were re-anesthetized (5 min induction with 3% isoflurane, 70% N<sub>2</sub>O, 30% O<sub>2</sub>, maintenance with 1% isoflurane, 70% N<sub>2</sub>O, 30% O<sub>2</sub>), intubated and mechanically ventilated (Stoelting) and given rocuronium (10 mg/kg, i.a.) and penicillin G (20,000 IU/kg, i.m.). Head and body temperature were maintained at normothermic temperatures (37 ± 0.5°C) using rectal and temporalis muscle thermistors connected to feedback-regulated heating lamps. Physiological parameters (blood pO<sub>2</sub>, pCO<sub>2</sub> and pH, mean arterial blood pressure) were monitored via a tail artery catheter and maintained at normal levels. Brain trauma was produced with a fluid-pulse (14–16 ms duration, 2.0 ± 0.2 atm) at the craniotomy site. Sham-operated animals received all surgical procedures identical to the TBI animals with the exception of the fluid-pulse. At the end of the surgery, animals received buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg, s.c.) to minimize pain and distress. Criteria for exclusion from the study were: mortality, &gt;15% loss of body weight, non-resolving infection at the surgical site, inability to feed or drink, motor paralysis, listlessness, self-mutilation, excessive grooming leading to loss of dermal layers, spontaneous vocalization when touched or poor grooming habits. Attrition rate was 3.5% for sham animals (1 animal due to mortality, 1 due to infection) and 7% for TBI animals (4 animals due to mortality after surgery).</p>

<p>For flow cytometry experiments, animals received either vehicle (5% DMSO in saline, 6 ml/kg, i.p.) or A33 (0.3 mg/kg, 6 ml/kg, i.p.) at 30 min after TBI. For the 24 hr endpoint, animals received a second dose of either vehicle or A33 at 5 hrs post-surgery. At 3 or 24 hrs post-surgery, animals were deeply anesthetized (3% isoflurane, 70% N<sub>2</sub>O, 30% O<sub>2</sub>, 5 min) and transcardially perfused with PBS (4°C), pH 7.4, (75 mL) for 6 minutes. The ipsilateral parietal cortex was dissected on ice. Tissue was mechanically dissociated into a single-cell suspension and cells were labeled for surface markers CD45 Alexa 647 (202212, 1.25 μg/ml, BioLegend) and CD11b v450 (53-4321-80, 1 μg/ml, eBioscience). The surface markers CD45 and CD11b were used to distinguish between CD45<sup>low</sup> microglia (CD45<sup>low</sup>, CD11b<sup>+</sup>) and CD45<sup>high</sup> infiltrating myeloid-lineage cells (CD45<sup>high</sup>, CD11b<sup>+</sup>). Neutrophils are a subset of infiltrating myeloid-lineage cells and were labeled with RP-1 PE (550002, 20 μg/ml, BD Bioscience) to distinguish them from other CD45<sup>high</sup> cells. Dead cells were excluded from analysis by labeling with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR dead cell stain (L10119, 1 μl/ml, Life Technologies). Cells were fixed and permeabilized with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization kit (554714, BD Biosciences). For intracellular labeling, the cells were probed for either PDE4B2 (ABS181, 2 μg/ml, EMD Millipore), or iNOS Alexa 488 (53–5920, 5 μg/ml, eBioscience) and Arg1 PE (IC5868P, 7.5 μg/ml, R&amp;D Systems). PDE4B2 staining was detected with PE-conjugated secondary antibody (12-4739-81, 10 μg/ml, eBioscience). Antibody isotype controls provided by manufacturers were used to establish gates during analysis. Flow cytometry data was acquired on a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

<title>Cylinder test</title>
<p>Animals were evaluated for spontaneous forelimb placement in a transparent Plexiglas cylinder (20 cm diameter x 30 cm height) for 5 min. The cylinder dimensions encouraged vertical exploration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref053">53</xref>]. Animals were first evaluated for baseline behavior in the cylinder test at 1–3 days prior to surgery, and were re-evaluated at 1 week post-surgery. The number of times the right or left forelimb made contact with the wall while the animal was rearing was counted. Asymmetry index was calculated by dividing the number of contralateral (left) forelimb touches by total forelimb touches. For each animal, asymmetry index at 1 week post-surgery was normalized to baseline asymmetry index to account for any pre-operative bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref054">54</xref>].</p>

The following day, animals were returned to the apparatus for 3.5 min. After the initial 2 min, a 30 sec tone (75 dB, 2.8 kHz) was delivered that coterminated with a 1 mA foot shock (1 sec duration). Animals remained in the apparatus for 1 min post-shock. The apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol between each trial. At 24 hrs and 1 month (6 weeks post-surgery) after training, contextual fear conditioning was evaluated by placing the animals in the apparatus and measuring freezing for 5 min. Contextual fear conditioning comparisons were made between freezing on the training day during the initial 2 min, designated as training, and freezing in the context on the testing days. Video-based analysis was used to quantify freezing behavior (FreezeFrame 3.32, Coulbourn Instruments). Shock threshold was measured at 6 weeks post-surgery after completion of contextual fear conditioning. Animals received a 1 sec foot shock every 30 sec in 0.02 mA increments beginning at 0.1 mA.

The escape platform (9.3 cm diameter) was submerged 1.5 cm below the surface of the water and remained invariant in location. Animals received four 60 sec acquisition trials per day for 4 days with an intertrial interval of 4–6 min. If the animal was unable to reach the platform within 60 sec, it was guided to the platform and remained on the platform for 10 sec.

<title>PDE4B2 is expressed in inflammatory cells acutely after TBI</title>

This time point was selected because PDE4B2 is elevated in the injured cortex at 24 hrs after TBI, and it also corresponds to the peak of neutrophil infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref045">45</xref>].

Animals received sham or TBI surgery and were then treated with A33 (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) at 30 min and 5 hrs post-surgery.

Given that PDE4B knockout mice have reduced neutrophil infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref026">26</xref>], we determined whether a PDE4B inhibitor could reduce neutrophil accumulation after TBI. To evaluate this, flow cytometry was used to determine neutrophil accumulation in the ipsilateral parietal cortex of vehicle and A33-treated TBI animals at 3 and 24 hrs after surgery (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0178013.g003">Fig 3</xref></bold>). Neutrophils were identified as a subset of infiltrating myeloid-lineage cells (CD45<sup>high</sup>, CD11b<sup>+</sup>) using a rat neutrophil-specific marker, RP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref057">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref058">58</xref>]. At 3 hrs post-injury, neutrophils were present in the injured cortex of both vehicle and A33-treated animals (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0178013.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref></bold>), but were not reduced with A33 treatment at this time point (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0178013.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>). At 3 hrs post-injury, neutrophils made up approximately 80% of infiltrating myeloid-lineage cells in both vehicle and A33-treated TBI animals (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0178013.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>). When evaluated at 24 hrs after TBI, A33-treated TBI animals had significantly reduced infiltrating myeloid-lineage cells and neutrophils (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0178013.g003">Fig 3E–3G</xref></bold>), with neutrophils making up approximately 90% of the infiltrating myeloid-lineage population in the injured brain (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0178013.g003">Fig 3H</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Cortical contusion volume is reduced with A33 treatment</title>
<p>While there are many factors that contribute to the developing contusion after brain injury, inflammation is one of the key driving forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref060">60</xref>]. Given that acute A33 treatment reduced inflammation, we next wanted to determine whether this treatment also reduced contusion volume.

<title>Effects of a PDE4B inhibitor on behavioral recovery after TBI</title>
<p>Given that acute A33 treatment reduced inflammation and cortical contusion volume, we determined whether this treatment paradigm also reduced sensorimotor and learning and memory deficits after TBI. From 1 to 6 weeks post-surgery, animals were serially evaluated for sensorimotor and learning and memory deficits using the cylinder test, contextual fear conditioning, water maze and a working memory task.</p>
<p>To evaluate sensorimotor deficits, we utilized the cylinder test. This task quantifies spontaneous asymmetrical forelimb use and reliably detects deficits in models that produce substantial unilateral damage, such as TBI and focal cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref062">62</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Approximately 80% of TBI survivors will develop learning and memory deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref004">4</xref>]. Therapeutics targeting the TBI-induced inflammatory response have yielded promising results in preclinical studies for reducing neuronal loss and memory deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref068">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref070">70</xref>]. In this study, we set out to determine whether a PDE4B-selective inhibitor, A33, would reduce inflammation and improve outcome after TBI. The results of this study demonstrate that acute treatment with a PDE4B-selective inhibitor, A33, reduces inflammation, pathology and memory deficits after TBI. The partial rescue in memory deficits, atrophy and neuronal loss after TBI is suggestive that the therapeutic benefits of acute PDE4B inhibition persist for weeks after treatment.</p>
<p>In 2009, Naganuma and colleagues reported the discovery of a PDE4B-selective inhibitor, compound 33 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref048">48</xref>]. Prior to the discovery of compound 33, now termed A33, the high structural similarity between PDE4B and PDE4D precluded the development of PDE4B-selective inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref048">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref049">49</xref>]. In this seminal paper, Naganuma <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that A33 was not only highly selective for PDE4B, but also had good pharmacokinetic properties, with 85% bioavailability in mice when administered orally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref048">48</xref>]. However, whether systemic administration of A33 reached levels capable of inhibiting PDE4B in the rat brain acutely after TBI was unknown. Thus, we measured A33 in the brain at 6 hrs after sham or TBI surgery. At 6 hrs post-surgery, A33 reached concentrations 4 to 7-fold above the IC<sub>50</sub> for PDE4B. Furthermore, A33 levels were nearly 2-fold higher in the injured brain than in the uninjured. The increased distribution of A33 in the acutely injured brain are contrary to what was previously observed in chronic A33-treated animals, where there was no significant difference in brain A33 levels in sham versus TBI animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref050">50</xref>]. The increased levels of A33 in the injured brain are likely due to blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown at this early time point after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref071">71</xref>]. However, the brain/plasma ratio was relatively low in both sham and TBI animals, possibly due to a high efflux of A33 (efflux ratio = 14.4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref050">50</xref>]. One caveat of these results is that the animals were not perfused prior to tissue collection. Therefore, when measuring brain levels of A33, both residual blood and brain tissue were evaluated. Studies are currently in progress to improve the pharmacokinetics of A33, specifically regarding chemical modifications that will increase A33 distribution in the brain.</p>
<p>In addition to examining the distribution of A33 in the injured brain, we tested whether this PDE4B-selective inhibitor was capable of augmenting cAMP levels after TBI. A recent study by Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that A33 augments cAMP levels in isoproterenol-stimulated hippocampal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref047">47</xref>]. In the context of TBI, we previously reported that the pan-PDE4 inhibitor, rolipram, rescued basal cAMP deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref012">12</xref>]. However, contrary to those previous studies, we found that A33 did not significantly increase basal cAMP levels after TBI. This negative result is likely because rolipram inhibits all PDE4 subfamilies, whereas A33 is selective for PDE4B. While this study focused on the PDE4B subfamily, we previously reported that PDE4D2 expression and PDE4A5 phosphorylation are significantly increased in the injured cortex acutely after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref045">45</xref>]. Thus, PDE4A and 4D subfamilies may have contributed to the decrease in basal cAMP levels after TBI. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that PDE4B regulates cAMP levels near the plasma membrane and in mitochondria, but not in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref072">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref073">73</xref>]. In contrast, PDE4D predominantly hydrolyzes cytosolic cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref072">72</xref>]. Consequently, the cAMP assay used in this study may not have been sensitive enough to detect PDE4B-mediated changes in basal cAMP levels after TBI. Future studies evaluating PDE4B inhibitors would benefit from the use of cAMP-sensitive fluorescent sensors to detect localized changes of cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref072">72</xref>].</p>
<p>The short PDE4B isoform, PDE4B2, has been implicated in regulating the activation of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, microglia and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref043">43</xref>]. In a previous study, we found that PDE4B2 is significantly increased in the injured cortex and hippocampus as early as 30 min post-injury, and remained elevated up to 24 hrs after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref074">74</xref>]. However, whether PDE4B2 was upregulated in particular inflammatory cell populations in the injured cortex had not been determined. Using flow cytometry, we found that PDE4B2-expressing CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly increased in the injured cortex at 24 hrs after TBI. This increase in PDE4B2<sup>+</sup> cells was due to an increase in both PDE4B2-expressing microglia and infiltrating myeloid-lineage cells. However, the mechanism that regulates this increase in PDE4B2 expression in inflammatory cells is unknown. One possible mechanism for the TBI-induced increase in PDE4B2 expression in microglia and infiltrating myeloid-lineage cells is through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Several studies have reported that TLR4 signaling, via LPS stimulation, increases expression of PDE4B2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref075">75</xref>]. After TBI, the time course of TLR4 upregulation parallels the acute increase observed in PDE4B2 expression, and TLR4 has been shown to localize to microglia and neutrophils acutely after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref076">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref078">78</xref>]. Furthermore, TLR4 knockout mice have reduced inflammation and improved outcome after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref079">79</xref>]. Altogether, these findings suggest that additional studies delineating the mechanisms that regulate PDE4B2 expression could provide additional targets, such as TLR4, for reducing inflammation and improving recovery after TBI.</p>
<p>After TBI, neutrophil accumulation has been associated with histopathological damage and poor recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref031">31</xref>]. Treatment strategies aimed at reducing neutrophil accumulation after TBI have yielded positive results, with improved neuronal survival and behavioral recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref033">33</xref>]. Given that PDE4B knockout and A33-treated mice have reduced neutrophil accumulation in systemic models of inflammation, we tested whether A33 treatment reduced neutrophil accumulation after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref048">48</xref>]. Using flow cytometry, we determined whether A33 treatment reduced neutrophil accumulation at 3 and 24 hrs after TBI, which corresponds to the early and peak infiltration time points after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref027">27</xref>]. At 24 hrs, but not 3 hrs after injury, A33 treatment significantly reduced neutrophil accumulation. The reduction in peak neutrophil accumulation at 24 hrs but not at 3 hrs suggests that the immediate influx of neutrophils after TBI may not be dependent on PDE4B-regulated pathways. While the exact mechanism responsible for the A33-mediated reduction in neutrophil accumulation at 24 hrs after TBI is unknown, studies using PDE4B knockout mice suggest that these findings are due to decreased CD18 expression in circulating neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref026">26</xref>]. CD18 is an important mediator of neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion and infiltration, and expression of CD18, like PDE4B2, is regulated by TLR4 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref080">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref082">82</xref>]. Overall, these results suggest that PDE4B is a possible therapeutic target for reducing peak neutrophil accumulation after TBI.</p>
<p>Pan-PDE4 inhibitors have been found to regulate the activation state of microglia and macrophages during the early inflammatory response after CNS injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref038">38</xref>]. Two commonly used markers of classical (M1) and alternative (M2) activation are iNOS and Arg1, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref039">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref083">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref084">84</xref>]. Therefore, in this study we used iNOS and Arg1 as markers to determine whether the PDE4B-selective inhibitor, A33, alters the activation state of microglia and myeloid-lineage cells after TBI. At 3 hrs, but not 24 hrs after injury, A33 treatment significantly increased the percentage of Arg1-expressing microglia and infiltrating myeloid-lineage cells. The upregulation of Arg1 at 3 hrs, but not 24 hrs, in the A33-treated TBI animals suggests that this effect does not persist at longer time points after A33 treatment, given that the final dose was administered at 5 hrs after TBI. Due to the emerging evidence on the complexity of M1/M2 phenotypes, we cannot definitively conclude whether acute PDE4B inhibition induces an M2 activation state after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref085">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref088">88</xref>]. Nevertheless, the reduction in neutrophil accumulation at 24 hrs post-injury, which was preceded by an early increase in Arg1-expressing microglia and infiltrating myeloid-lineage cells, is suggestive of a more anti-inflammatory/pro-reparative environment with A33 treatment.</p>
<p>While we previously demonstrated that acute PDE4B inhibition reduces TNF levels after TBI, future studies will benefit from a more comprehensive assessment of changes in the cytokine and chemokine profile with PDE4B inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref050">50</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated that PDE4 negatively regulates cAMP levels in pathways that control the expression and anti-inflammatory effects of interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-13 and IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref052">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref089">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref090">90</xref>]. These cytokines, as well as Arg1, are considered M2 markers in microglia and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref091">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref092">92</xref>]. Moreover, these markers are regulated by cAMP-Stat6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6) signaling pathways, suggesting that PDE4B inhibition may induce expression of multiple M2 markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref093">93</xref>]. Overall, a greater understanding of the anti-inflammatory actions of PDE4B inhibitors would have therapeutic implications not just for TBI, but also for CNS injuries and diseases where PDE4B is upregulated.</p>
<p>Cerebral contusions and hematomas are a common type of mass lesion after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref059">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref094">94</xref>]. These lesions can be life-threatening and lead to life-long disabilities if not properly mitigated, which in clinical settings is often accomplished through surgical intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref095">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref096">96</xref>]. Preclinical studies have implicated the acute inflammatory response in exacerbating cerebral contusions and hematomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref060">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref097">97</xref>]. This inflammatory response further drives BBB breakdown, increases hemorrhage and exacerbates the developing contusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref071">71</xref>]. Thus, a therapeutic that has the ability to attenuate the acute inflammatory response may also reduce the extent of hemorrhage and contusion after TBI. At 3 days post-injury, we found that A33 treatment significantly reduced contusion volume. These results differed from what we previously observed when evaluating the pan-PDE4 inhibitor, rolipram, acutely after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref022">22</xref>]. While pan-PDE4 inhibition worsened cortical contusions acutely after TBI, acute PDE4B inhibition reduced cortical contusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref022">22</xref>]. This reduction in contusion volume is suggestive of a reduction in BBB breakdown in A33-treated TBI animals. BBB breakdown is seen within minutes to hours after TBI and is associated with neutrophil infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref071">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref098">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref099">99</xref>]. Thus, the reduction in both neutrophil accumulation and cortical contusion volume in A33-treated TBI animals suggests that PDE4B may be a biological target for reducing BBB breakdown after TBI. One possible mechanism for this reduction in BBB breakdown may be through upregulation of endothelial adherens junctions, such as VE-cad (vascular endothelial cadherin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref100">100</xref>]. VE-cad is essential for proper BBB function, and expression of VE-cad is positively regulated by cAMP signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref101">101</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref102">102</xref>]. Furthermore, augmented VE-cad levels are associated with reduced BBB breakdown acutely after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref103">103</xref>]. Regardless of the mechanism, the reduction in cortical contusion volume in this study supports the use of PDE4B inhibitors as a treatment for attenuating cerebral contusion progression after TBI.</p>
<p>Learning and memory deficits are common long-term consequences in both experimental and clinical TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref053">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref064">64</xref>]. Previously, we reported that delayed A33 treatment reduced memory deficits at 3 months post-TBI, but the treatment was limited to 30 min prior to training in the learning task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref050">50</xref>]. In this study, we tested whether acute A33 treatment reduced TBI-induced memory deficits several weeks after the treatment period. We found that acute A33 treatment partially rescued memory recall in the water maze task. This improvement in recent memory recall was further supported by a partial rescue in contextual fear conditioning deficits at 24 hrs post-training. However, the improvement in contextual fear conditioning was not persistent, and remote recall at 1 month post-training (6 weeks after surgery) was not improved with A33-treatment. These results suggest that the memory trace during recall and consolidation at the 24 hr testing time point was not sufficient to sustain the fear memory at 1 month after training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref104">104</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref105">105</xref>]. This long-term cognitive decline may be due in part to the progressive hippocampal atrophy caused by TBI, which was not mitigated with acute A33 treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref066">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref106">106</xref>]. Acute A33 treatment did significantly reduce cortical atrophy, as well as neuronal loss in the hippocampal CA3 region and pericontusional cortex. Although the reduction in hippocampal CA3 neuronal loss may have partially reduced TBI-induced memory deficits, this neuronal sparing was not enough to demonstrably reduce hippocampal atrophy. The apparent discrepancy between the improved CA3 neuronal survival and unaffected hippocampal atrophy may be due to the combined reduction in the number and volume of remaining neurons in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref066">66</xref>]. While we quantified the number of remaining neurons in the hippocampal CA3 region, we did not measure neurite length and synaptic density. Several studies have demonstrated that TBI causes a decrease in dendrite length and synaptic density in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref107">107</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref109">109</xref>]. Therefore, the partial rescue in the number of hippocampal CA3 neurons may have been surpassed by the atrophy of the remaining neurons in the A33-treated TBI animals. Future studies attempting to reduce hippocampal atrophy may benefit from a more extended treatment course with A33 after injury. Altogether, this study suggests that acute A33 treatment is capable of improving recent memory recall at chronic time points after TBI, possibly through a partial reduction in CA3 neuronal loss.</p>
<p>The neuroprotective benefits of pan-PDE4 inhibitors are well documented in models of TBI, SCI and cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref110">110</xref>]. After TBI, neuronal damage in the injured cortex and hippocampus can be seen within minutes after injury and progresses to measurable neuronal loss within hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref111">111</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref112">112</xref>]. In this study, we examined some of the anti-inflammatory actions of A33 treatment as a potential mechanism for reducing neuronal loss and memory deficits after TBI. However, an unexplored mechanism in which A33 may prevent neuronal loss after TBI is through cell survival pathways. Previously, we reported that chronic A33 treatment significantly increased basal levels of phosphorylated cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) in the injured hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref050">50</xref>]. CREB acts downstream of cAMP and increased levels of phosopho-CREB (Ser133) are often used as a surrogate measure to evaluate increases in cAMP signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref064">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref113">113</xref>]. In cell survival pathways, phosopho-CREB can activate transcription of anti-apoptotic genes, such as <italic>bcl-2</italic> (B-cell lymphoma 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref114">114</xref>]. Furthermore, preclinical TBI studies have demonstrated that overexpression of Bcl-2 attenuates both cortical and hippocampal CA3 neuronal loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref115">115</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref116">116</xref>]. However, in this study we did not examine whether pro-survival pathways were augmented in neurons when treated with A33 acutely after TBI. One potential mechanism in which increasing cAMP, via PDE4B inhibition, may promote neuronal survival is through elevated mitochondrial CREB activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref117">117</xref>]. Mitochondria play a major role in regulating apoptotic signaling, and some of these anti-apoptotic pathways involve mitochondrial CREB-mediated activation of cell survival pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref114">114</xref>]. In support of this hypothesis, studies have demonstrated that PDE4B2 and an associated anchoring protein, DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1), colocalize in neuronal mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref073">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref118">118</xref>]. Furthermore, we previously found that PDE4B2 is upregulated in cortical and hippocampal dendrites early after brain injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref074">74</xref>]. However, whether the TBI-induced increase in neuronal PDE4B2 expression occurs within mitochondria is unknown. Moreover, whether PDE4B2 negatively regulates CREB-mediated neuronal survival pathways has not yet been established. With the development of PDE4B-selective inhibitors, such as A33, future studies could explore the role of PDE4B as a dual anti-inflammatory/pro-survival target for a wide array of neurological injuries and diseases.</p>
<p>This is the first study to investigate the therapeutic potential of acute treatment with a PDE4B-selective inhibitor after TBI. While we found that A33 treatment reduced several TBI-induced pathologies, there are several limitations of the current study. The early administration of A33 at 30 min post-injury is a significant limitation with regards to clinical translation. This treatment time was chosen to optimize observing a potential effect of A33, given the rapid onset of inflammation after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref119">119</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref121">121</xref>]. However, this time point is not feasible for many TBI patients. On average, the earliest time point a TBI patient is evaluated and treated by a physician varies between 1–6 hrs after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref122">122</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref123">123</xref>]. Therefore, future studies are needed to evaluate the therapeutic time window for acute A33 treatment after TBI. Another limitation of the current study is the lack of efficacy of A33 to improve several cognitive measures evaluated in this study. While acute A33 treatment rescued deficits in contextual fear conditioning and water maze retention, neither working memory nor contextual fear conditioning at 1 month post-training were improved. The lack of efficacy could have been due to a suboptimal dosing schedule. Assessing a dose-response curve, as well as evaluating other dosing schedules, are necessary to increase the likelihood for successful clinical translation in future studies. Another possible explanation for the lack of efficacy observed in some of the behavioral measures is the possible contribution of other PDE4 subfamilies to TBI-induced cognitive deficits. We previously reported that phospho-PDE4A5 and PDE4D2 are elevated in the injured cortex and hippocampus acutely after TBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref074">74</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated a potential role for these PDE4 isoforms in cognition. Li <italic>et al</italic>. reported that knockout of PDE4D enhanced water maze retention and novel object recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref124">124</xref>]. Additionally, a study from Havekes <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that augmenting levels of PDE4A5 in mice impaired both contextual fear conditioning and novel object recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref125">125</xref>]. Therefore, other PDE4 subfamilies may have contributed to the cognitive deficits caused by TBI. Future studies evaluating the therapeutic window and dose-response curve of acute A33 treatment, as well as investigating the contribution of other PDE4 isoforms to TBI pathology, will clarify the potential of PDE4B-selective inhibitors as acute therapeutics for TBI.</p>
<p>Over the last 40 years, there has been extensive development in the use of pan-PDE4 inhibitors as anti-inflammatory treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref126">126</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref127">127</xref>]. Currently, there are two FDA-approved pan-PDE4 inhibitors available for clinical use, Roflumilast and Apremilast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref128">128</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0178013.ref129">129</xref>]. However, lack of specificity for individual PDE4 subfamilies has hindered their use after TBI. Overall, this study demonstrated that a PDE4B-selective inhibitor, A33, can reduce inflammation, histopathology and memory deficits after TBI. The multifactorial and beneficial effects observed with A33 treatment support the use of PDE4B inhibitors as an anti-inflammatory, and possibly neuroprotective, treatment strategy for TBI.</p>
