<abstract>
<p>Although arsenite [As(III)] is non-essential and toxic for plants, it is effectively absorbed through various transporters into the roots. Here we identified a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK31) response for As(III) tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We identified CPK31 as an interacting protein of a nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP1;1), an aquaporin involved in As(III) uptake. Similarly to the <italic>nip1;1</italic> mutants, the loss-of-function mutants of <italic>CPK31</italic> improved the tolerance against As(III) but not As(V), and accumulated less As(III) in roots than that of the wild-type plants. The promoter-<italic>β</italic>-glucuronidase and quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis revealed that <italic>CPK31</italic> displayed overlapping expression profiles with <italic>NIP1;1</italic> in the roots, suggesting that they might function together in roots. Indeed, the <italic>cpk31 nip1;1</italic> double mutants exhibited stronger As(III) tolerance than <italic>cpk31</italic> mutants, but similar to <italic>nip1;1</italic> mutants, supporting the idea that CPK31 might serve as an upstream regulator of NIP1;1. Furthermore, transient <italic>CPK31</italic> overexpression induced by dexamethasone caused the decrease in As(III) tolerance of transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines. These findings reveal that CPK31 is a key factor in As(III) response in plants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arsenic (As) is a metalloid and present as pentavalent arsenate [As(V)] and trivalent arsenite [As(III)] that reversibly convert depending on the redox status of the environment. Typically, As(V) and As(III) are the prevalent form in aerobic or anaerobic soils, respectively[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref001">1</xref>]. Although As is a non-essential element in plants, it can accumulate in crop plants, specially rice, and deposit into grains when the soil and water are contaminated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref003">3</xref>]. Crops exhibit a range of As toxicity symptoms that are detrimental to growth and yield once As accumulation reaches beyond an optimal level, and may eventually pose a potential health risk to their consumers including animals and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref003">3</xref>]. Due to its toxicity, universal distribution, and tendency to accumulate in animals and humans, As is ranked as one of the most toxic elements and defined as a group I carcinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>As(V), as a phosphate analogue, has a strong affinity with iron oxides or hydroxides in the soil, and its concentration is normally under 2.3 μM even in a highly As-contaminated soil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref007">7</xref>]. As(V) thus enters plant roots mainly through the high-affinity phosphate transporters, such as PHT1;1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and OsPT8 in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref009">9</xref>]. After acquisition, As(V) is rapidly reduced to As(III) by the enzyme arsenate reductase, and As(III) consequently acts as the predominant form of As for As extrusion, long-distance transport and sequestration in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref010">10</xref>]. As(III) is uncharged at neutral pH in flooded paddy soils, and is more soluble and mobile compared with As(V). As(III) enters the cells mainly through nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins (NIPs) subfamily of aquaporin proteins that belong to the major intrinsic proteins (MIPs), a family essentially facilitates the diffusion of water and small uncharged solutes in all domains of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref011">11</xref>]. Plant NIPs are remarkably well conserved across species, and can be divided into five well-defined subgroups (specified as NIP1-NIP5) according to phylogenetic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref011">11</xref>]. In addition to As(III), NIPs are also involved in the uptake and extrusion of other metalloids, including antimonite, boron, silicon and selenium, into or out of the plants and distribution within the plant body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Several NIPs are permeable for As(III). Exogenous expression of AtNIP1;1 enhanced the As(III) uptake into the oocytes, as did its close homologue AtNIP1;2, and OsNIP1;1 and OsNIP3;1 from rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition, NIP1;2, NIP3;1, NIP5;1, NIP6;1, and NIP7;1 of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, OsNIP2;1 and OsNIP3;2 from <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, HvNIP1;2 from barley, and LjNIP5;1 and LjNIP6;1 from <italic>Lotus japonicas</italic> are all permeable to As(III) in the yeast expression system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref016">16</xref>]. Among nine members of the NIP subfamily in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, NIP1;1 was firstly identified as a determinant of As(III) tolerance using a forward genetics screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref013">13</xref>]. NIP1;1 is highly expressed in roots and localized at the plasma membrane, and its loss-of-function mutants displayed an As(III)-tolerant phenotype with strong growth of roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref013">13</xref>], indicating that NIP1;1 is a critical As(III) transporter that mediates toxic As(III) uptake into roots. However, little is known about potential signaling mechanisms that allow roots to regulate NIP1;1 activity in response to As(III) toxicity.</p>
<p>GmNod26, a NIP family member abundantly targeted to the symbiosome membrane of nitrogen-fixing nodules of soybean roots, has been shown to be phosphorylated by a symbiosome membrane-associated calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK) on Ser-262 of C-terminal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref018">18</xref>]. CPKs contain calmodulin-like Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding domains and a kinase domain in a single protein, and have therefore been recognized as the major transducers of calcium signals and catalyze the phosphorylation of multiple proteins, including membrane channels, pumps, and a number of metabolic enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref019">19</xref>]. More studies have shown that several members of CPKs physically associate with ion channels and transporters to effectively regulate their activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref024">24</xref>]. Therefore, it is conceivable that CPKs fulfills critical functions in regulating the activity of NIP1;1 involved in As(III) uptake in the roots.</p>
<p>In the present study, we report the identification of CPK31 as a major component controlling As(III) tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Our genetic and biochemical studies indicate that CPK31 fulfils this function by interaction with NIP1;1, providing a novel role of CPK31 in controlling As(III) toxicity in plants.</p>

<p>Surface-sterilized seeds were plated on half-strength MS medium containing various sodium arsenite concentrations with 1% (w/v) sucrose and pH was adjusted to 5.7, and solidified using 0.8% (w/v) agar. Seedlings were grown on vertically placed plates in the chambers at 23–24°C with light intensity of 150 μmol·m<sup>−2</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup> and 16:8 h light/dark photoperiods. The seedlings grown for 14 days after germination were imaged for measuring primary root lengths of plants using the ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>), and then were collected for weighing the whole-plant biomass. For soil culture, 3-day-old seedlings germinated on half-strength MS medium were carefully removed to the nutrient-rich soil. For hydroponic culture, 7-day-old seedlings grown on half-strength MS medium were transferred into liquid 1/6 MS medium for further growth. The soil and hydroponic cultured plants were grown in the greenhouse under 150 μmol·m<sup>−2</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup> light intensity with a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod at 22°C.</p>

<title>CPK31 physically interacts with NIP1;1</title>
<p>CPKs act as major calcium sensors and transducer, and play a fundamental role in growth, development and stress responses in plants. We have established a yeast two-hybrid system and successfully identified a number of interaction partners between the kinases and ion channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref027">27</xref>]. We hypothesized that some of CPKs may interact with and regulate the activity of AtNIP1;1 involving in As(III) uptake in the roots. To test this possibility, we thus screened all CPK members in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> to find potential candidates physically interacting with AtNIP1;1 by using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Among the 34 members of CPKs tested, we found that only CPK31 (AT4G04695) interacted physically with the putative cytoplasmic hydrophilic domain at N-terminal of AtNIP1;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>CPK family members were detected at multiple subcellular locations, including cytosol and plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref019">19</xref>]. To determine the subcellular localization of CPK31 in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells, we transiently expressed a CPK31-GFP fusion protein in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> protoplasts. The CPK31-GFP signal appeared at the plasma membrane, while the control GFP was localized to the cytoplasm under confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Moreover, CPK31-GFP green signal was colocalized with the red signal of FM4-64, a plasma membrane-specific dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), confirming that CPK31 appears in the plasma membrane. This result is consistent with the prediction of membrane subcellular location of CPK31 with a myristoylation motif at N-terminal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref019">19</xref>]. Similarly, GFP-tagged AtNIP1;1 signal appeared at the plasma membrane and overlapped with the FM4-64 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), exhibiting plasma membrane localization at the mesophyll protoplast, consistent with the observation in the root epidermal cells of the transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>To further confirm that the interaction between CPK31 and AtNIP1;1 could occur in plant cells, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay was performed in protoplasts of suspension cultured <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mesophyll. The fluorescence signals were primarily detected at plasma membrane of the cells co-expressing AtNIP1;1 and CPK31, while no fluorescence signals were detected in the cells expressing the fusion of AtNIP1;1-SPYNE or CPK31-SPYCE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that the interaction between of CPK31 and AtNIP1;1 primarily occurs at the plasma membrane of plant cells.</p>

<title>The <italic>cpk31</italic> mutants are more tolerant to As (III) than the wild-type plants</title>
<p>Work by Kamiya et al (2009) demonstrated that NIP1;1 plays a negative role in plant survival under high-As(III) conditions, because the <italic>nip1;1</italic> loss-of-function mutants are more As-resistant than the wild-type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref013">13</xref>]. It is believed that NIP1;1 mediates As(III) uptake into the roots thus contributes to the toxicity of external As(III). However, the mechanisms for activating NIP1;1 activity are still unknown. Some CPKs have been shown to activate channels by interacting with the channel proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref024">24</xref>], and some inhibit the activity of channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref022">22</xref>]. Based on our findings of interaction of CPK31 and AtNIP1;1, we tested the possible regulatory mechanism of CPK31 on AtNIP1;1 by using transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines.</p>
<p>We isolated and characterized T-DNA insertional alleles in the <italic>CPK31</italic> gene, including <italic>cpk31-1</italic> (SALK_049228), <italic>cpk31-2</italic> (SALK_007777) and <italic>cpk31-3</italic>(SALK_049236) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). <italic>CPK31</italic> mRNA was not detectable by RT-PCR in homozygous plants of either T-DNA allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), indicating that T-DNA insertions inside the gene disrupted the expression of <italic>CPK31</italic> transcripts. To investigate the role of the <italic>CPK31</italic> gene in the regulation of As(III) tolerance, we used two As(III) toxicity resistant lines, <italic>nip1;1–1</italic> and <italic>nip1;1–2</italic> T-DNA inserted mutants used in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref013">13</xref>], as positive controls. When grown on the normal medium without As(III), all <italic>cpk31</italic> and <italic>nip1;1</italic> mutant seedlings showed similar phenotype to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). However, in the presence of 5 and 10 μM As(III), the growth of <italic>cpk31-1</italic>, <italic>cpk31-2</italic> and <italic>cpk31-3</italic> seedlings, although not as good as <italic>nip1;1–1</italic> and <italic>nip1;1–2</italic> mutant seedlings, was better than the wild-type, indicating CPK31 may regulate As(III) uptake under these conditions. With the increase in As(III) concentrations, the <italic>cpk31</italic> mutant seedlings displayed more similar phenotype to <italic>nip1;1–1</italic> and <italic>nip1;1–2</italic> mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g002">Fig 2C–2E</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref> respectively showed that root growth and biomass in the <italic>cpk31-1</italic>, <italic>cpk31-2</italic> and <italic>cpk31-3</italic> seedlings were significantly more tolerant to 20 and 40 μM As(III) treatment compared to the wild-type, and are similar to the <italic>nip1;1</italic> mutant plants. These findings support a model that CPK31 might interact with and regulate AtNIP1;1 activity in As(III) transport.</p>

<p>Earlier studies have shown that As(V) and As(III) enter plant roots via two different systems: As(V) is taken up via phosphate transport family (PHT), while As(III) is transported by NIPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref008">8</xref>]. Furthermore, after absorbed into roots, As(V) was widely accumulated in the endodermis, the apex (meristem) and cap of roots, whereas As(III) was mostly accumulated in the endodermis as detected by X-ray fluorescence microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref033">33</xref>].

<title>The <italic>cpk31</italic> mutants contain less As(III)</title>
<p>As(III) tolerance is determined by multiple processes, including acquisition and distribution.

In addition to expressed in primary roots, <italic>CPK31</italic> promoter the junction of primary root and lateral roots showed strong GUS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g005">Fig 5I</xref>), It was noted that the activity of the <italic>CPK31</italic> promoter was very high in guard cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g005">Fig 5E</xref>), overlapping with the expression pattern of the <italic>NIP1;1</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref013">13</xref>]. We subsequently observed <italic>CPK31</italic> gene promoter in leaves of the four-week-old seedlings, and found that the activity of promoter was highly expressed in the vascular tissues of mature leaves with higher levels at cauline leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g005">Fig 5J</xref>) than rosette leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g005">Fig 5K</xref>), consistent with the qRT-PCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<p>The assays described above indicated overlapping expression pattern of <italic>CPK31</italic> and <italic>NIP1;1</italic> in roots. We subsequently investigated whether mRNA levels of those two genes are regulated by As(III) treatment. After grown in normal hydroponic medium for 3 weeks, plants were transferred to the medium with 10 μM As(III). The roots and shoots of plants were collected at different time points and their mRNA levels were examined by qRT-PCR analysis. When exposed to As (III), both <italic>CPK31</italic> and <italic>NIP1;1</italic> mRNA levels in roots decreased within 12 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>CPK31</italic> and <italic>NIP1;1</italic> in shoots responded to As(III) differently: <italic>CPK31</italic> mRNA levels stayed relatively stable, but the mRNA of <italic>NIP1;1</italic> increased. However, the mRNA levels of <italic>CPK31</italic> and <italic>NIP1;1</italic> altered more in roots than in shoots in response to As(III) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g006">Fig 6</xref>). These results suggest that CPK31 and NIP1;1 might be functionally relevant, at least in roots, to decrease As(III) uptake under conditions of As(III) toxicity.</p>

<p>To analyze whether CPK31 is one of crucial regulators for NIP1;1 activity, we examined the As(III)-tolerant phenotype of wild-type, <italic>nip1;1</italic>, <italic>cpk31 nip1;1</italic> double mutant seedlings grown on 1/2 strength MS agar plates under As(III) conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g007">Fig 7</xref>, <italic>cpk31 nip1;1</italic> double mutants significantly enhanced root growth as compared with <italic>cpk31</italic> mutants, with longer primary root length and more biomass. Additionally, the growth phenotype of <italic>cpk31 nip1;1</italic> double mutants is similar to that of <italic>nip1;1</italic> mutants treated with As(III). Together, these results suggest that CPK31 might be one of factors for mediating NIP1;1 activity response for As(III) stress <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Because the knockout of <italic>CPK31</italic> caused an increase in As(III) tolerance, we tried to find whether overexpression of <italic>CPK31</italic> had a contrary response to As(III) in Arabidopsis. Thus, we constructed a dexamethasone (DEX)-inducible <italic>CPK31</italic> expression system (InCPK31) in the <italic>cpk31-1</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g008">Fig 8</xref>). We selected three lines of plants transformed with InCPK31, InCPK31#15, InCPK31#18, and InCPK31#21, as their <italic>CPK31</italic> expression was significantly induced by DEX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). The inducible expression system did not cause the changes in growth at the absence of DEX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g008">Fig 8A and 8C</xref>). However, the root length of plants transformed with <italic>CPK31</italic> expression system (InCPK31), InCPK31#15, InCPK31#18, and InCPK31#21 was much shorter when these seedlings were grown at the medium containing DEX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g008">Fig 8A and 8C</xref>), at which <italic>CPK31</italic> expression was significantly induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are crucial signaling molecules that mediate responses to diverse endogenous and environmental cues. In the present study, we provide evidence that CPK31 appears to regulate As (III) uptake in roots through interaction with As (III)-permeable aquaporin NIP1;1. This finding provides evidences of key roles of CPK31 in the regulation of As(III) toxicity in plants.</p>
<p>CPKs comprise a large family of serine/threonine kinases in plants (34 genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>) with the conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF hands in the calmodulin-like domain. This unique molecular structure allows that CPKs could be directly activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and function as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref019">19</xref>]. Some studies proposed that CPKs could be involved in As(V) toxicity to some extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref034">34</xref>]. However, whether CPKs are involved in As(III)-mediated signaling pathway and their potential functions in defending against As(III) toxicity remain to be discovered. We found that CPK31 was down-regulated by As(III) treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g006">Fig 6</xref>), whereas several <italic>CPKs</italic> were up-regulated by As(V) stress in the rice roots by the transcriptomic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref034">34</xref>], suggesting that CPKs may have contrary roles in As(III) and As(V) tolerance. Three homozygous T-DNA-insert knockout lines of <italic>CPK31</italic> (<italic>CPK31-1</italic>, <italic>-2</italic> and <italic>-3</italic>) all had the enhanced As(III)-tolerant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and <italic>cpk31-1</italic> mutants accumulated As at a significantly lower rate in both roots and shoots than the wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Furthermore, transient CPK31 overexpression induced by DEX caused the decrease in As(III) tolerance of transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g008">Fig 8</xref>). These results indicate that CPK31 involving in As(III) uptake in roots and distribution in shoots.</p>
<p>As distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor in plants, several CPKs, including CPK2, CPK13, CPK20, CPK21, CPK23, and CPK32, physically interacted with various channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref024">24</xref>]. Our results in this paper showed that CPK31 specifically interacts with NIP1;1 using yeast two hybrid screening, and used BiFC-based assays to confirm that the this interaction exists in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g001">Fig 1</xref>). CPK31 contains a myristoylation site at its N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref019">19</xref>], known for targeting proteins to cellular membranes. The site could recruit CPK31 to the plasma membrane, where its anchoring target NIP1;1 lies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g001">Fig 1</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref013">13</xref>]. Therefore, it will be interesting to further disclose whether the existence of CPK31-involving Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway for NIP1;1 functions.</p>
<p>CPK31 is mainly expressed at the vascular bundle but not root tips of the primary roots detected by histochemical staining of promoter-<italic>CPK31</italic>:<italic>GUS</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g005">Fig 5</xref>), with the similar patterns to NIP1;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref013">13</xref>]. Moreover, RT-PCR analysis of <italic>CPK31</italic> and <italic>NIP1;1</italic> transcripts in root tissues indicated both expression of <italic>CPK31</italic> and <italic>NIP1;1</italic> was down-regulated once the roots were exposed to 10 μM As(III) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The decrease of <italic>NIP1;1</italic> and <italic>CPK31</italic> expression in presence of As(III) might result from the idea that NIP1;1 may not be "originally" designed to be As(III) carrier. For example, NIP1;1 also transports Sb(III) and determines the Sb(III) sensitivity of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref012">12</xref>]. Thus, plants adapt to As(III) toxicity by developing this "avoidance" mechanism.</p>
<p>The overlapping expression profiles of <italic>CPK31</italic> and NIP1;1 in the roots are consistent with the interaction with each other. Interestingly, most As(III) was accumulated in these sites of roots exposed to As(III) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref033">33</xref>]. The loss-of-function mutants of CPK31 improved the specific tolerance of roots against As(III) but not As(V) (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g003">3</xref>), and accumulated less As(III) in roots than those of the wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g004">Fig 4</xref>). It is noteworthy that <italic>cpk31</italic> mutants contained more As(III) with lower As(III) tolerance in the roots compared with <italic>nip1;1</italic> mutants, indicating that CPK31 might be one of the kinases involving in As(III) uptake by NIP1;1. This hypothesis is further supported by the observations that roots of <italic>cpk31 nip1;1</italic> double mutants showed stronger As(III) tolerance than <italic>cpk31</italic> mutants, whereas similar to <italic>nip1;1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173681.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Moreover, as CPK31 is also present in other tissues such as the vascular tissues of leaves, stems and flowers, we speculate that it may function together with other components in those tissues as well, for example in the long-distance transport and distribution of As(III) throughout the whole plant, the functions of NIP1;1 was not involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>As (III) is high toxic to organisms, due to its high affinity to bind with sulfhydryl groups of many proteins and then disrupting many key metabolic processes in the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref004">4</xref>]. Several members of NIP aquaporins have been shown to function in As(III) uptake, including AtNIP1;1, AtNIP3;1 and AtNIP7;1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and OsNIP2;1 in rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref016">16</xref>]. It has been reported that GmNOD26 could be activated by the unknown CPKs in soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0173681.ref017">17</xref>], but very little is known about potential signaling mechanisms that regulate these NIP aquaporins. Our study here has demonstrated that CPK31 might target and regulate NIP1;1 for As(III) tolerance, providing the first case for this notion that CPKs regulate As(III) sensitivity</p>
