<abstract>
<p>Development of predictable <italic>in vitro</italic> tumor models is a challenging task due to the enormous complexity of tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. The closer the resemblance of these models to human tumor characteristics, the more suitable they are for drug-development and –testing. In the present study, we generated a complex 3D lung tumor test system based on acellular rat lungs. A decellularization protocol was established preserving the architecture, important ECM components and the basement membrane of the lung. Human lung tumor cells cultured on the scaffold formed cluster and exhibited an up-regulation of the carcinoma-associated marker mucin1 as well as a reduced proliferation rate compared to respective 2D culture. Additionally, employing functional imaging with 2-deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) these tumor cell cluster could be detected and tracked over time. This approach allowed monitoring of a targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment in the <italic>in vitro</italic> lung tumor model non-destructively. Surprisingly, FDG-PET assessment of single tumor cell cluster on the same scaffold exhibited differences in their response to therapy, indicating heterogeneity in the lung tumor model. In conclusion, our complex lung tumor test system features important characteristics of tumors and its microenvironment and allows monitoring of tumor growth and -metabolism in combination with functional imaging. In longitudinal studies, new therapeutic approaches and their long-term effects can be evaluated to adapt treatment regimes in future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lung cancer is the major cause of cancer related death worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref001">1</xref>]. Despite vigorous research efforts, the 5 year-survival rate of lung cancer patients remains at about 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref002">2</xref>]. In recent years improved molecular characterization of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) led to a better understanding of certain driver mutations and new targeted treatment options. The success of anti-tumor therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors for patients harboring activating EGFR mutations is only one example emphasizing the potential for personalized treatment approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref003">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, only the small subset of NSCLC patients carrying this genetic mutation benefits from such treatments and secondary mutations often lead to drug resistance, followed by tumor progression and ultimately death of the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref004">4</xref>]. Thus, there is an urgent scientific and medical need for a refined understanding of lung tumor biology including mechanisms of tumor heterogeneity and resistance to provide optimal strategies and promising drug combinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref005">5</xref>] to treat lung cancer in an individual patient.</p>
<p>Despite extensive preclinical testing, many newly developed oncologic drugs fail clinically—predominantly at a late stage in phase II and III trials—making drug-development a cumbersome and extremely cost- and time-consuming process. This is especially prominent in the field of oncology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref010">10</xref>]. One reason for this is the lack of appropriate predictive model systems to distinguish efficient from non-efficient drug compounds early and cost-effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref013">13</xref>]. The response of tumors to drugs is influenced by a complex interaction of several factors, including tissue-specific microenvironment, cell type specific response and mechanical stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref017">17</xref>]. All of these are poorly reflected by conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures. Animal models better reproduce <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue characteristics and have massively contributed to our understanding of tumor biology. However, the transferability of results into the human setting is limited owing to e.g. the chimeric nature of the resulting tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref022">22</xref>]. Thus, there is still an urgent need for reliable, organotypic tumor models with high predictive power regarding clinical effectiveness and with the potential to use primary patient-derived cells for testing of individual responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref023">23</xref>].</p>
<p>Three dimensional (3D) human tumor models represent a promising option to bridge the gap between 2D cultures and animal models. Tissue engineering strategies offer powerful tools to build up artificial tissues and test systems. Especially, the use of tissue-specific extracellular matrix (ECM) holds great potential, as the tissue-specific composition directly influences cellular processes and identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref025">25</xref>]. Various approaches have shown success, ranging from a small-scale alveolar-capillary barrier model on a micro-chip device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref026">26</xref>] to hydrogel-based models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref027">27</xref>] and <italic>in vitro</italic> generated transplantable rodent lung tissue from a decellularized organ scaffold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref028">28</xref>]. So far, a focus has been on hydrogels, predominantly on Matrigel<sup>™</sup>, a hydrogel based on an extract from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref029">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref031">31</xref>], as their chemical and structural properties, such as porosity, pore size, permeability and mechanical stability, can be controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref033">33</xref>]. Matrigel<sup>™</sup> contains basement membrane components such as laminin and collagen as well as a variety of growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref034">34</xref>], but also displays a high variability in the composition between different batches impeding reproducibility and complicating drug screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to establish a 3D organotypic lung tumor model in which lung tumor biology as well as new therapeutic strategies can be investigated and using a non-destructively a clinically relevant read-out modality. Based on an acellular rat lung scaffold and human NSCLC cell lines, our lung tumor test system provided distinct tumor nodules in a tissue-specific environment, which adapt an <italic>in vivo</italic>-like phenotype. Using functional imaging with 2-deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), a widely used method for diagnosis, staging and prognostication of lung cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref036">36</xref>], tumor cell clusters could be detected and tracked over time and response to treatment to with a targeted therapy could be monitored.</p>

<title>Ethics statement</title>
<p>All animals were bred in the in-house animal facility and received standard animal care and proper attention in compliance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institute of Health (NIH publication no. 85e23, revised 1996). No approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) was required for the organ removal according to the animal welfare act §4. Only the minimal number of 35 animals necessary to produce reliable scientific data was used. All animals were sacrificed by exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> without any prior interventions. Of the sacrificed animals not only the lung but also further organs for other research purposes were explanted.</p>

<sec id="sec004">
<title>Preparation of rat lungs</title>
<p>8 to 9 weeks old Lewis rats (Charles River, Germany) were euthanized by exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> (Cp pharma, Germany). PBS containing 50 U/ml Heparin (Ratiopharm, Germany) was perfused through the right ventricle to prevent blood clotting. Lung and heart were excised en bloc. The pulmonary artery and trachea were cannulated with 18G and 14G catheters (Braun, Germany), respectively. An additional catheter was sutured into the left atrium of the heart to establish a circulation.</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Decellularization of lungs and characterization of lung scaffolds</title>
<p>In order to generate acellular lung scaffolds, we tested four different protocols (detailed below) and finally chose the H<sub>2</sub>O—sodium deoxycholate (SDC) procedure for further studies, which is a protocol adapted from the generation of the porcine BioVaSc<sup>®</sup>-TERM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref037">37</xref>] depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160282.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. The decellularization process was performed under non-sterile conditions at room temperature. Peristaltic pumps (Ismatec, Germany) were used for the vascular perfusion via the pulmonary artery and were controlled by a pressure sensor. The flow rate was automatically adjusted to maintain a pressure according to the specific protocol. The resulting scaffolds were exposed to 25 kGy gamma-radiation for sterilization performed by the company BBF Sterilisationsservice GmbH (Rommelshausen, Germany).</p>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>H<sub>2</sub>O –SDC—Protocol</title>
<p>Isolated lungs were instilled with 3 mL deionized water and perfused with 500 mL deionized water at a mean pressure of 15 mmHg. After each 100 mL of fluid the perfusion was stopped and 3 mL fresh deionized water was infused via the trachea into the lung. This perfusion process was repeated until the vasculature had been rinsed with 500 mL deionized water. Lungs were then filled with 3 mL of deionized water and incubated in deionized water at 4°C overnight on a rocking platform shaker. The next day, 3 mL 2% SDC/H<sub>2</sub>O (deionized) were applied to the trachea; subsequently, lungs were perfused with 2% SDC/H<sub>2</sub>O at a pressure of 20 mmHg. After 100 mL decellularization fluid had run through the vasculature, perfusion was interrupted; lungs were filled with 3 mL 2% SDC and allowed to deflate before continuing the process of perfusion until 500 mL 2% SDC had been perfused through the lungs. Following immersion and incubation in 2% SDC/H<sub>2</sub>O at 4°C on shaker overnight, lungs were washed by perfusion of 500 mL PBS at a mean pressure of 20 mmHg. Every 100 mL perfused, lungs were filled with 3 mL PBS via the trachea. To remove residual genomic DNA from the matrix, 3 mL PBS with calcium and magnesium ions containing 333.33 μg/mL DNaseI were injected into the trachea, pulmonary artery and the lungs were incubated in this solution at 4°C overnight on a rocking platform shaker after which it was stored in PBS.</p>

<sec id="sec007">
<title>SDS-Protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref028">28</xref>]</title>
<p>Lungs were perfused via the pulmonary artery maintaining a mean pressure of 30 mmHg. Lungs were successively perfused with 0.1% SDS in deionized water for 2 h, deionized water for 15 min and 1% Triton X-100 in deionized water for 10 min. Next, the vasculature was rinsed with PBS for 60 min. Finally, lungs were stored in PBS containing 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin at 4°C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>CHAPS-Protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref038">38</xref>]</title>
<p>For decellularization, 3 mL PBS containing 8 mM 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio] -1-Propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 1 M NaCl and 25 mM EDTA were instilled into the trachea after which the vasculature was perfused with PBS for 30 min. Subsequently, 500 mL of the CHAPS containing decellularization solution were perfused through the vasculature; lungs were then rinsed with 500 mL PBS. A mean pressure of 20 mmHg was maintained for all perfusion periods. Following, lungs were incubated in PBS containing 1% Penicillin/ Streptomycin at 4°C for 48 h, changing the solution every 24 h, under constant agitation. Next, a DNase digestion step was performed over night as described above at 4°C under constant agitation, after which the scaffolds were stored in PBS.</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Triton—SDC—Protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref039">39</xref>]</title>
<p>Resected lungs were incubated in deionized water for 1 h at 4°C. Following, 3 mL deionized water were manually injected into the vasculature via the pulmonary artery and subsequently into the trachea using a 5 mL syringe. After deflation, this process was repeated 4 further times. Next, 3 mL 0.1% Triton X-100/ H<sub>2</sub>O (deionized) were instilled into both the trachea and the vasculature, the lungs were submerged in this solution and incubated for 24 h at 4°C under constant agitation. The next day, lungs were washed five times with 3 mL deionized water as before. Thereafter, 3 mL 2% SDC were injected into both, trachea and pulmonary artery, and the organ was immersed and incubated in this solution for 24 h at 4°C. Following another washing step (5-times 3 mL deionized water), lungs and vasculature were filled and submerged with 3 mL 1 M NaCl in deionized water containing 5% Penicillin/ Streptomycin for 1 h at RT under constant shaking and washed again (5 times 3 mL deionized water in both trachea and pulmonary artery).

<p>For the analysis of lung scaffolds, acellular matrices as well as native lungs were sectioned as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160282.s002">S2 Fig</xref>. and used for quantification of DNA-, collagen-, and elastin-concentration as well as for histology and ultrastructure examination as annotated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160282.s007">S2 Table</xref>.</p>
<p>To detect residual DNA in acellular lung matrices, the dsDNA PicoGreen Assay (Life Technologies, Germany) was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

<title>Establishment of a decellularization protocol for rat lungs preserving lung architecture, basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM) components</title>
<p>In order to determine the most suitable protocol for complete decellularization of rat lungs and optimal preservation of matrix structure and components, a protocol adapted from the decellularization of porcine jejunum established by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref037">37</xref>] was compared to three previously published procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref039">39</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160282.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Our protocol utilizing H<sub>2</sub>O in a first step, followed by sodium deoxycholate (H<sub>2</sub>O-SDC), generated a scaffold of macroscopically white appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160282.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Successful removal of cells and maintenance of lung architecture, including the basement membrane, was verified on the light microscopic and ultra-structural level employing scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160282.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In order to quantify structural preservation, the percentage of airspace in the decellularized scaffolds was assessed using H&amp;E staining and compared to native tissue. Approximately half of the area of cross sections of distal native rat lung tissue consisted of air (55.3 ± 2.6%) and no significant difference could be measured in acellular lungs generated by H<sub>2</sub>O-SDC (52.8 ± 3.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160282.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). DNA concentration was significantly reduced after decellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160282.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, p = 0.04) in accordance with the absence of nuclei in H&amp;E staining. Regarding ECM components, collagen and elastin are of major importance in the lung, as they ensure the stability and elastic recoil of the lung. Compared to native rat lung tissue, decellularized matrices exhibited a higher collagen concentration by tendency and comparable amounts of elastin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160282.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). In line with this, the presence of collagen and elastic fibers could be visualized using Movat’s pentachrome, Elastica van Gieson and immunohistochemical staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160282.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0160282.s005">S5</xref> Figs).

<title>Uptake of FDG by lung cancer cell lines in conventional 2D culture</title>

<title>FDG-PET is suitable to detect tumor nodules in a 3D lung tumor model</title>
<p>Based on this, we investigated if FDG uptake of tumor cell clusters on the 3D lung scaffold could specifically be detected using PET imaging.

<p>In order to assess the suitability of functional PET-imaging as a non-destructive and clinically relevant read-out in the lung tumor test system, scaffolds repopulated with either HCC827 or A549 cells were treated with 1 μM gefitinib and examined by FDG-PET at baseline, 24 h and 72 h post treatment induction. Compared to the pre-therapeutic uptake, median TBR of HCC827 tumor nodules was reduced by 36% (median TBR 2.6, range 1.0 to 4.6) 24 h and by 48% (median TBR 2.13, range 1.2 to 4.5) 72 h after treatment induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160282.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). In contrast, median FDG uptake by A549 nodules increased from 2.70 at baseline to 5.15 (range 3.7 to 7.2; 191%; 24 h) and 3.98 (range 1.9 to 8.6; 147%; 72 h) in the presence of gefitinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160282.g004">Fig 4D and 4E</xref>). In line with this, only very few proliferative HCC827 cells could be detected after 72 h of gefitinib treatment, while the proliferation of A549 cells was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160282.g003">Fig 3H and 3I</xref>).</p>
<p>Tracking individual HCC827 nodules, already 24 h after treatment induction a significant reduction in FDG retention was observed in all cases but one; further 48 h of treatment (72 h time point) resulted in an additional moderate decrease in most (15/20) nodules and in enhanced tracer retention in five cases. However, FDG uptake by these five nodules still was significantly lower compared to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160282.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). For tumors formed by A549 cells severely enhanced FDG uptake was observed in 7/10 cases after 24 h and the remaining three only showed a moderate reduction (15–30%). Further exposure to gefitinib led to a slight drop in tracer intensity in 6/10 and a slight increase or no change in 4/10 cases; FDG uptake was significantly higher after 72 h of treatment in 9/10 nodules compared to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0160282.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). In conclusion, the targeted treatment approach using gefitinib reduced FDG uptake and retention specifically in the sensitive HCC827 nodules while the resistant A549 tumor models showed increasing FDG uptake during the 72 h treatment period. Moreover, FDG-PET imaging revealed that individual tumor nodules varied in their drug response.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we introduce an organotypic 3D human lung cancer model that can be used to explore basic tumor biology and metabolism and to simulate a biomarker-guided therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that a thorough investigation of an <italic>in vitro</italic> tumor model is feasible using non-destructive molecular PET-imaging. We are convinced that this innovative combination of advanced tissue engineering with functional imaging will enable longitudinal studies regarding tumor growth, -metabolism and –heterogeneity and the evolution of resistance as well as the evaluation of new therapeutic strategies and long-term effects of treatment.</p>
<p>For the establishment of cancer models with high predictive power, the generation of an organotypic microenvironment, in which the tissue-specific architecture, including tissue perfusion, and the ECM are reproduced is critical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref047">47</xref>]: while the ECM constitutes the anchorage for cells and is able to influence cellular phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref048">48</xref>], the basement membrane might influence tumor cell behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref049">49</xref>] and crossing this barrier is an important step in tumor progression and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref051">51</xref>]. Together, an organotypic environment has an impact on cell morphology, growth, differentiation, drug response, signaling and the malignant phenotype of tumor cells.</p>
<p>One promising approach to recreate tissues <italic>in vitro</italic> is the decellularization of donor organs and repopulation of these cell-free scaffolds with human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref055">55</xref>]. Comparing four decellularization protocols for rodent lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref039">39</xref>], we found that tracheal and vascular application of H<sub>2</sub>O, followed by SDC was superior in terms of preservation of structure and ECM components. Additionally, standardized generation of organotypic scaffolds and test systems with our H<sub>2</sub>O-SDC protocol seemed feasible. This low variation might be due to the application of a distinct perfusion pressure instead of manual injection, which allowed the use of an automated pressure-controlled applicator. Upon repopulation of scaffolds, lung tumor cell lines formed distinct tumor nodules predominantly at the periphery even under simplified static culture conditions. This location corresponds to the origin of adenocarcinomas <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref057">57</xref>]. Additionally, tumor cells in our model exhibited specific characteristics of complex tumor tissues, such as a reduced proliferation rate (compared to the respective 2D cultures) and an upregulated and depolarized expression of the carcinoma-associated marker MUC1 which is associated with dedifferentiation and oncogenic signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref058">58</xref>]. The extremely high proliferation rate of conventional 2D models contrasts with that of most tumors in patients and is a major challenge in drug testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref061">61</xref>]. Our observations are in agreement with a published study in which comparison of 3D gene expression data sets of A549 cells in Matrigel<sup>™</sup>-based models and on an acellular rat lung under perfusion revealed a clear benefit over 2D cell cultures: The gene expression pattern of cells on the lung scaffold showed high similarity to tumors of patients with poor prognosis while the Matrigel<sup>™</sup>-based model resembled the phenotype of patients with better prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref062">62</xref>]. Thus, our organotypic lung tumor model seems to be a suitable system for the reliable in depth analysis of tumor biology and the testing of drugs and treatment strategies. A clear advantage over Matrigel<sup>™</sup> tumor models is based on the reflection of the complex lung architecture, which hydrogels cannot offer. The high batch-to-batch variability and the undefined growth factor composition further complicate the standardization and validity of the gel-based tumor models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref035">35</xref>], rendering them more suitable for less complex applications such as invasion assays in lung tumor models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref063">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref064">64</xref>]. Additionally, our organotypic model allows perfusion of the scaffold similar to the blood circulation in the physiologic situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>In order to further validate our model and establish a non-destructive, clinically relevant read-out that allows long-term studies, we aimed to set up functional imaging with FDG-PET for the lung tumor models. Proof of concept experiments in 2D cultures demonstrated specific FDG uptake by NSCLC cell lines which reduced FDG retention upon treatment in EGFR-mutant and therefore gefitinib-sensitive HCC827 cells (54, 55, 56, 57, 32) but not in the resistant A549 cells. These data suggest the feasibility of using FDG retention to monitor tumor metabolism and response to therapy and are in agreement with the proven value of FDG-PET for diagnosis, staging and monitoring of therapeutic responses of patients with lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref065">65</xref>]. Transferring these findings to the 3D lung tumor model and actual PET-imaging is not trivial, as the size of tumor nodules has to exceed the resolution limit of 1.4 mm of the μPET-scanner in order to allow analysis of individual tumor cell clusters. However, various distinct regions with high radioactivity were detected by PET and correlation of autoradiographic analyses with DAPI staining of the same section demonstrated the presence of tumor cell clusters in these regions. Thus, FDG is specifically taken up by tumor cells and not by scaffold components, proving the validity of FDG uptake in the organotypic tumor model. Furthermore, identical positioning and placement of repopulated lung scaffolds on a Petri dish and in the PET-scanner allowed tracking the development of tumor cell clusters over time. Importantly, targeted therapy with gefitinib significantly decreased FDG uptake by most HCC827 cell clusters as early as 24 h after treatment induction, but had no effect on A549 tumor nodules. This indicates that not only specific responses to therapy can be analyzed by PET in our model, but also at a very early time point at which changes in classical tumor markers presumably are not evident yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref066">66</xref>]. Interestingly, different HCC827 nodules on the same scaffold varied in their ability to respond to therapy and in the duration of the response, suggesting the development of an at least modest degree of tumor heterogeneity in this model after culture of 14 days.</p>
<p>Taken together our data show that FDG-PET-imaging of organotypic 3D human lung cancer models is a reliable method to detect and track tumor formation. Owing to the non-destructive nature and the ability to place the lung scaffolds exactly as desired, longitudinal studies are feasible. This implies that long-term effects of therapeutic regimen and the evolution of resistance can be investigated, especially when combined with immunohistochemical, flow cytometric and molecular biological analyses. Many different mechanisms of drug resistance in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cells have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref067">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0160282.ref068">68</xref>] which could be investigated further in this model. Translating such approaches to patient derived primary lung tumors would be a great step forward regarding personalized medicine. Thus, a detailed investigation of tumor metabolism and its drug-induced changes might be possible using radiotracers, such as radioactively labelled glutamine, methionine, choline or tyrosine. Moreover, new tracers for diagnosis, staging, prognostication and theranostic approaches e.g. for endo-radiotherapy can be tested, meeting a clinical need for more specific tracers than FDG: although lung cancer is one of the few conditions for which FDG-PET is accredited, false positive results due to inflammatory lesions are a common problem and false negative results might arise from lung cancer histotypes that are not FDG-avid. Ultimately these approaches could—besides deepening our knowledge of cancer biology—lead to the identification of radiotracers that could serve as biomarkers which might help to establish more effective and less toxic individualized therapies.</p>

<title>Evaluation of decellularization protocols.</title>
<p>(A) The percentage of airspace in the decellularized matrices was compared to native lungs to quantify the structural preservation for different decellularization protocols. While scaffolds generated using Triton-SDC and H<sub>2</sub>O-SDC exhibited similar values to native tissue, the CHAPS- and SDS scaffolds showed a slightly increased percentage of airspace, indicating a loss of interstitial tissue or elasticity. (B) Remaining DNA, a quality characteristic of decellularization, was reduced in all scaffolds, except the SDS-protocol (data are presented as arithmetic means ± SEM; n = 5, *p&lt;0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). (C) Residual DNA in the scaffold was visualized by Feulgen staining. The staining confirms presence of DNA with high regional variance in the scaffolds produced by SDS, and the absence of DNA in all other lung matrices.

<title>Evaluation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in decellularized lung scaffolds.</title>
<p>(A) Acellular lungs generated by SDS- and CHAPS-protocols tend to contain a lower amount of collagen per mg dry tissue than the scaffolds generated with Triton-SDC or H<sub>2</sub>O-SDC. While these exhibited significantly higher collagen content than native rat lungs (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively, Kruskal-Wallis test).
