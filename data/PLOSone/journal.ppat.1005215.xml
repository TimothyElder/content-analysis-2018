<abstract>
<p>A SARS-CoV lacking the full-length E gene (SARS-CoV-∆E) was attenuated and an effective vaccine. Here, we show that this mutant virus regained fitness after serial passages in cell culture or <italic>in vivo</italic>, resulting in the partial duplication of the membrane gene or in the insertion of a new sequence in gene 8a, respectively. The chimeric proteins generated in cell culture increased virus fitness <italic>in vitro</italic> but remained attenuated in mice. In contrast, during SARS-CoV-∆E passage in mice, the virus incorporated a mutated variant of 8a protein, resulting in reversion to a virulent phenotype. When the full-length E protein was deleted or its PDZ-binding motif (PBM) was mutated, the revertant viruses either incorporated a novel chimeric protein with a PBM or restored the sequence of the PBM on the E protein, respectively. Similarly, after passage in mice, SARS-CoV-∆E protein 8a mutated, to now encode a PBM, and also regained virulence. These data indicated that the virus requires a PBM on a transmembrane protein to compensate for removal of this motif from the E protein. To increase the genetic stability of the vaccine candidate, we introduced small attenuating deletions in E gene that did not affect the endogenous PBM, preventing the incorporation of novel chimeric proteins in the virus genome. In addition, to increase vaccine biosafety, we introduced additional attenuating mutations into the nsp1 protein. Deletions in the carboxy-terminal region of nsp1 protein led to higher host interferon responses and virus attenuation. Recombinant viruses including attenuating mutations in E and nsp1 genes maintained their attenuation after passage <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further, these viruses fully protected mice against challenge with the lethal parental virus, and are therefore safe and stable vaccine candidates for protection against SARS-CoV.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Zoonotic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and swine delta coronavirus (SDCoV) have recently emerged causing high morbidity and mortality in human or piglets. No fully protective therapy is still available for these CoVs. Therefore, the development of efficient vaccines is a high priority. Live attenuated vaccines are considered most effective compared to other types of vaccines, as they induce a long-lived, balanced immune response. However, safety is the main concern of this type of vaccines because attenuated viruses can eventually revert to a virulent phenotype. Therefore, an essential feature of any live attenuated vaccine candidate is its stability. In addition, introduction of several safety guards is advisable to increase vaccine safety. In this manuscript, we analyzed the mechanisms by which an attenuated SARS-CoV reverted to a virulent phenotype and describe the introduction of attenuating deletions that maintained virus stability. The virus, engineered with two safety guards, provided full protection against challenge with a lethal SARS-CoV. Understanding the molecular mechanisms leading to pathogenicity and the <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of vaccine genetic stability contributed to a rational design of a promising SARS-CoV vaccine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are pathogens responsible for a wide range of existing and emerging diseases in humans and other animals [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A novel coronavirus causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) was identified in Southeast China in 2002. SARS-CoV rapidly spread worldwide to more than 30 countries within six months, infecting 8000 people and leading to death in approximately 10% of the cases [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. While SARS-CoV has not reappeared in humans, CoVs including those similar to SARS-CoV, are widely disseminated in bats circulating all over the world, making future SARS-CoV outbreaks possible [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, in September 2012, a novel coronavirus infecting humans, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified in two patients with severe respiratory disease in Saudi Arabia [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], again indicating that emergence of other highly pathogenic CoVs is likely. Thus, development of efficacious and safe vaccines and anti-virus therapies for these pathogens is essential.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus with a positive sense RNA genome of 29.7 kb that belongs to the <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> subfamily, genus <italic>β</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The virion envelope contains embedded three structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) and several group specific proteins: 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, and 7b [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The S protein, which mediates virus entry into host cells, the 3a protein and the M proteins, induce neutralizing antibodies, with those specific for S protein being most protective [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The SARS-CoV S and N proteins trigger T cell responses [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which are also important for protection and enhance the kinetics of virus clearance [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p>
<p>SARS-CoV E protein is a small integral membrane protein of 76 amino acids that contains a short hydrophilic amino-terminus followed by a hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic carboxy-terminus [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. E protein oligomerizes to form an ion-conductive pore in membranes [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and contains a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) formed by its last four carboxy-terminal amino acids [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. PDZ domains are protein-protein recognition sequences, consisting of 80 to 90 amino acids that bind to peptide sequences (PBMs) [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These protein-protein interactions modulate cellular pathways important for viral replication, dissemination in the host and pathogenesis [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We previously demonstrated that a SARS-CoV lacking the E gene (SARS-CoV-∆E) was attenuated in different animal models [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], indicating that SARS-CoV E protein is a virulence factor. SARS-CoV lacking the E protein fully protected both young and elderly BALB/c mice against challenge with virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; therefore, rSARS-CoV-∆E is a promising vaccine candidate. Live attenuated vaccines are considered highly effective because of their ability to replicate within host cells, resulting in high levels of antigenic stimulation, and robust long-term immunological memory [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
<p>However, a major safety concern with live attenuated vaccines is the possibility of reversion to a pathogenic form. CoVs are prone to RNA recombination and mutation in tissue culture and during animal infection [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], so it is crucial that rSARS-CoV-∆E be thoroughly studied after serial passage. In this study, we show that passage of viruses lacking all or part of the E protein in Vero E6 cells and mouse DBT-mACE2 cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] led to the incorporation of compensatory insertions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, passage of SARS-CoVs lacking the E protein PBM led to regeneration of viral proteins containing PBMs, either by incorporation of novel chimeric proteins or by the insertion of new PBMs into existing proteins, such as the 8a protein or the E protein if E was only partially deleted. Strikingly, these modifications were not observed after passage of SARS-CoVs with mutated E protein that retained the PBM. In fact, we have shown that if instead of deleting the full-length E protein, only small deletions of 8–12 amino acids were introduced into the carboxy-terminus of E protein with retention of the PBM, the SARS-CoVs generated were attenuated and genetically stable both in cell culture or in mice. While this partial E protein deletion resulted in virus stability, we also augmented vaccine safety by introducing mutations into the SARS-CoV nsp1 protein. The nsp1 protein of CoVs suppresses host gene expression by inducing host mRNA degradation and inhibiting protein translation [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and is an IFN antagonist [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Nsp1 deletions resulted in attenuated murine coronaviruses that fully protected against the challenge with parental virus [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this manuscript we show that small deletions within SARS-CoV nsp1 protein resulted in virus attenuation, associated with reduction of inflammation and higher levels of IFN-β and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Vaccination with mutated nsp1 variants protected against challenge with the virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (rSARS-CoV) virus. To generate safer vaccine candidates, viruses incorporating deletions in both the nsp1 and E proteins were constructed. These double mutants were protective against virulent virus challenge, and were genetically stable.</p>

<title>Stability of recombinant SARS-CoVs lacking the E protein in cell culture</title>
<p>To determine the stability of SARS-CoV-∆E, or of virus containing deletions of the E protein and several group specific genes including 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b (SARS-CoV-∆[E,6-9b]), we infected Vero E6 and DBT-mACE2 cells with rSARS-CoV, rSARS-CoV-∆E or rSARS-CoV-∆[E,6-9b]. Supernatants were serially passaged 16 times and the distal third of the genome, from the S gene to the 3´ end (around 8 kb), was sequenced using specific primers (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). In all cases, an insertion consisting of a partially duplicated M gene fused to the SARS-CoV leader RNA sequence, a 5´ sequence common to coronavirus mRNAs [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] was detected upstream of the native M protein (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). In contrast, no chimeric proteins were detected after serial passage of the parental virus. All MCH genes encoded the amino terminus and the three transmembrane domains of M and also different PDZ-binding motifs at the carboxy-terminus of the protein (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Genomic evolution occurred rapidly, as the chimeric genes were already detected within 5 passages in both cells lines, Vero E6 and DBT-mACE2.</p>

Top, ∆E p1 represents the genomic sequence of viruses lacking E protein at passage 1. Grey boxes indicate E gene with a partial deletion highlighted in light grey (∆). Transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) of the different genes are shown in blue boxes and the membrane gene (M) is shown in red. Chimeric membrane genes generated after 16 serial passages (p16) are formed by a partial duplication of membrane gene fused to part of SARS-CoV leader sequence (green boxes). TMD1, TMD2 and TMD3 represent the three different transmembrane domains contained within the first part of membrane gene. ATG and STOP represent the start and stop codon of potential proteins, respectively. EITL, RSVL and SLVL represent the last four amino acids of chimeric proteins that form PDZ-binding motifs. (B) Amino acid sequences corresponding to chimeric proteins generated after SARS-CoV-∆E passage in cell culture. New amino acids are shown in red. Presence of native membrane and chimeric membrane proteins was analyzed by Western blot at 24 hpi using two polyclonal antibodies generated to recognize either all membrane proteins, chimeric or not (C) or a unique sequence in the chimeric protein generated after SARS-CoV-∆E passage in DBT-mACE2 cells (D).</p>

<p>The expression of viral sgmRNAs corresponding to the chimeric genes was characterized by RT-PCR (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). We used RNA harvested from infected cells after serial passage, plaque purification and amplification along with specific primers (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). PCR products corresponding to specific MCH sgmRNAs were identified in MCH-Vero and MCH-DBT-infected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>). Expression of the chimeric proteins encoded by these sgmRNAs was confirmed using an antibody specific for all M and MCH proteins and a second one that recognized the MCH-DBT protein. Vero E6 cells were mock infected or infected with different recombinant viruses (rSARS-CoV, rSARS-CoV-∆E, rSARS-CoV-∆E-MCH-Vero and rSARS-CoV-∆E-MCH-DBT) at a moi of 0.3. The expression of native M and MCH was confirmed at 24 hpi by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). These results indicated that, after serial passages of SARS-CoVs lacking the E protein in cell culture, a similar type of chimeric membrane protein was generated in three independent experimental settings.</p>

<title>Growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-∆E containing MCH genes in cell culture</title>
<p>To test whether the presence of MCH genes conferred a replication advantage to SARS-CoV-∆E <italic>in vitro</italic>, the growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-∆E-MCH-Vero (MCH-Vero) and SARS-CoV-∆E-MCH-DBT (MCH-DBT) were analyzed. Vero E6 and DBT-mACE2 cells were infected with the recombinant viruses (moi of 0.001) and viral titers were determined at the indicated hpi (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). MCH-Vero and M<sub>CH</sub>-DBT viruses showed lower titers at 24 hpi in Vero E6 cells compared to rSARS-CoV but both virus titers of the two chimeric viruses and rSARS-CoV were similar at 72 hpi. In contrast, a 100-fold decrease in viral growth was observed in rSARS-CoV-∆E-infected cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Interestingly, chimeric proteins seemed to be specific for each cell type, as a ∆E virus containing a chimeric protein generated in Vero E6 cells (MCH-Vero) grew better in this cell line than in DBT-mACE cells, and the MCH-DBT virus generated in DBT-mACE2 cells specifically enhanced its growth in this cell line. This result indicated that the MCH protein provided a growth advantage for the virus, which partly compensated for the lack of the E protein.</p>

<p>To analyze the effect of the MCH protein on virus growth <italic>in vivo</italic>, BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with the recombinant viruses and euthanized at 2 and 4 dpi. Virus titers in the lungs were determined (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Viruses lacking the E protein, in the presence or absence of MCH protein, grew to lower titers in lungs at 2 and 4 dpi, as compared with those observed in mice infected with rSARS-CoV. Notably, rSARS-CoV-∆E replicated in the lung to higher levels than those containing the chimeric proteins (MCH-Vero and MCH-DBT) at both days p.i. Chimeric proteins only increased fitness in a cell type-dependent manner, i.e., viruses with the chimeric protein only grew better in the cell system in which this chimeric protein was generated. The virus containing a chimeric protein generated in Vero E6 cells grew better in this cell line, and the virus containing a chimeric protein generated in DBT-mACE2 cells showed an increased growth in these cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Lungs of mice infected with rSARS-CoV were highly edematous and showed profuse hemorrhagic areas at 2 and especially at 4 dpi (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>), leading to a significant increase in lung weight at 4 dpi (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>). Lung sections from mock-infected mice or mice infected with rSARS-CoV-∆E, MCH-Vero and MCH-DBT (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>) showed minimal damage at 2 and 4 dpi. In contrast, analysis of the lungs of mice infected with rSARS-CoV revealed extensive inflammatory cell infiltration and edema in alveolar and bronchiolar airways (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification of E protein domains restored by the generation of chimeric proteins</title>
<p>The chimeric protein MCH was generated after rSARS-CoV-∆E passage in cell culture, but not when full-length E protein was present, suggesting that it compensated for functions originally performed by E protein. To identify such E protein functional domains, a set of recombinant SARS-CoVs (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), with mutations or deletions in different regions of E protein [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], was passaged 16 times in Vero E6 cells (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). In Mut 1, several amino acid substitutions were introduced at the E protein amino-terminal region. rSARS-CoV deletion mutants ∆2, ∆3, ∆4, ∆5 and ∆6 included sequential or partially overlapping small deletions of 6 to 12 amino acids in the carboxy-terminus of E protein. Interestingly, the last 6 amino acids within the Δ6 virus (YSRVKN; <xref rid="ppat.1005215.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) revealed an alternative PBM at the carboxy-terminal domain of the protein [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In recombinant ∆PBM, the last 9 amino acids of E protein were deleted, truncating the carboxy-terminus and eliminating the E protein PBM. In mutPBM, the PBM was abolished by mutating the last 4 amino acids to glycine, maintaining the full-length E protein. In contrast, in altPBM, 4 amino acids within E protein carboxy-terminal region were mutated to alanine, maintaining an active PBM domain [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In SARS-CoV N15A and V25F mutants, ion channel activity of E protein was abolished by one point mutation in the transmembrane domain (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Vero E6 cells were infected with each of the recombinant viruses at a moi of 0.5 and supernatants were serially passaged for 16 times, and the presence of MCH gene was determined by sequence analysis. The results indicated that the MCH was not generated when the E protein contained a PBM sequence (rSARS-CoV, Mut 1, ∆2, ∆3, ∆4, ∆5, ∆6, altPBM, N15A and V25F) (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). When the PBM was absent (∆PBM and mutPBM), a new PBM containing the original sequence was added to the carboxy-terminal end of mutated E protein in all cases, reinforcing the importance of the PBM domain during infection. A virus incorporating the chimeric MCH protein was only generated when E protein was completely deleted (∆E), i.e., when the restoration of a PBM on the E protein was not possible.</p>

<p>To further analyze whether SARS-CoV requires a transmembrane protein containing a PBM, we generated two recombinant rSARS-CoV-∆E that contained artificial chimeric proteins (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). In SARS-CoV-∆E-MCH-EPBM (MCH-EPBM), a chimeric protein containing the first transmembrane domain of the M protein fused to the last nine amino acids of E protein, encompassing the PBM, was introduced. In SARS-CoV-∆E-3aCH-3aPBM (3aCH-3aPBM), the chimeric protein was formed by the first transmembrane domain of 3a protein and a PBM composed by the last nine amino acids of 3a protein (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Both viruses were passaged 16 times in Vero E6 cells and compensatory mutations were not detected after sequencing. All these data indicated that the virus requires a transmembrane protein displaying a PBM and that novel proteins with a PBM compensate for the loss of the E protein PBM.</p>

<title>Incorporation of a PBM domain after passage in the mouse lung</title>
<p>MCH-Vero and MCH-DBT exhibited an attenuated phenotype (see above). To analyze the genetic stability of recombinant SARS-CoV-∆E in BALB/c mice, virus was passaged every 48 hours by intranasal inoculation. A partial duplication of 45 nucleotides was found within 8a gene (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), leading to the incorporation of a fragment of 15 amino acids at the carboxy-terminus of 8a protein, and generating a novel 8a protein (8a-dup) with an internal PBM (CTVV) (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). To determine the virulence of this novel virus (SARS-CoV-∆E-8a-dup), we infected a new cohort of BALB/c mice and assessed survival and weight loss, and measured virus titers. Mice infected with SARS-CoV-∆E did not lose weight and all survived. In contrast, SARS-CoV-∆E-8a-dup grew to titers similar to those of rSARS-CoV and developed profound weight loss, developing signs of illness and death by 7 dpi (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Histological examination of lungs from SARS-CoV-∆E-infected mice showed absence of lung damage at both dpi. In contrast, lungs of mice infected with rSARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-∆E-8a-dup showed substantial perivascular, peribronchial and interstitial cellular infiltration and edema at 2 and 4 dpi (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). To further confirm the relevance of the partial duplication within 8a gene in the induction of virulence, a recombinant SARS-CoV-∆E with an 8a-dup gene was generated (rSARS-CoV-∆E-8a-dup). Virulence during infection with rSARS-CoV-∆E-8a-dup was evaluated as described above (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>).

<title>Mechanisms involving SARS-CoV-∆E-8a-dup reversion to virulence</title>
<p>SARS-CoV infection is associated with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

In contrast, infection with the recombinant virus lacking E protein at passage 0 (SARS-CoV-∆E) did not induce the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activation of p38 MAPK and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression during infection with rSARS-CoV-∆E-8a-dup were evaluated as described above. The engineered virus (rSARS-CoV-∆E-8a-dup) induced similar p38 MAPK activation (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>) and overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>) as compared with the SARS-CoV-∆E-8a-dup generated after SARS-CoV-∆E passage <italic>in vivo</italic>.

<title>Generation of recombinant SARS-CoV-nsp1* viruses</title>
<p>SARS-CoV-ΔE reverted to a virulent phenotype after serial passages in mice. To increase the genetic stability of the vaccine candidate, we introduced small attenuating deletions in the E gene, instead of deleting of the full-length E protein [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] as described above. In addition, to increase vaccine biosafety, we introduced additional attenuating mutations within the SARS-CoV nsp1 gene.

Based on this information, four mutant viruses (rSARS-CoV-nsp1*) were generated by introducing deletions of 8 to 11 amino acids into the nsp1 protein (rSARS-CoV-nsp1-∆A, -∆B, -∆C and -∆D <xref rid="ppat.1005215.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8A</xref>).

<title>Generation of rSARS-CoV mutants with deletions in both nsp1 and E genes</title>
<p>In order to develop a safe vaccine candidate, mutant viruses with deletions in both nsp1 and E genes were engineered. A rSARS-CoV deleted in the nsp1 D domain and the E protein (SARS-CoV-nsp1ΔD-ΔE), and a second mutant virus with deletions of the nsp1 D domain coupled with a small deletion (E∆3) (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>) in the E protein (SARS-CoV-nsp1ΔD-EΔ3) were generated. EΔ3 deletion mutant was selected for further studies because this deletion led to a virus that grew to titers similar or higher than the SARS-CoV-∆E, in cell culture or in mice, respectively (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g012" ref-type="fig">Fig 12A and 12B</xref>).

<title>Stability and pathogenicity of doubly mutant rSARS-CoV during passage in mice</title>
<p>To analyze the stability of rSARS-CoV with mutations in nsp1 and E in mice, SARS-CoV-nsp1ΔD-EΔ3 was passaged 10 times (p10M), followed by sequencing from the S gene to the 3´ end of the genome. Only two changes were observed in the viral sequence, one in the E gene (A26250T N→I), and a second one in the M gene (A26450G Q→R). The deletions introduced in the nsp1 and E genes were conserved, suggesting that this virus was essentially genetically stable <italic>in vivo</italic>. To analyze whether the E and M mutations could be compensatory mutations, virus titers at p1 and p10 were compared in Vero E6 and DBT-mACE2 cells. Titers of SARS-CoV-nsp1ΔD-EΔ3 (p10M) at different times post-infection were the same as those observed for rSARS-CoV (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g015" ref-type="fig">Fig 15A</xref>), indicating that the mutations increased virus replication.</p>
<p>To evaluate whether the compensatory mutations restored the pathogenicity of the virus, BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with rSARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-nsp1ΔD-EΔ3 (p10), and were daily monitored for 10 days. Mice infected with rSARS-CoV started to lose weight by day 2, and died by day 6 (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g015" ref-type="fig">Fig 15B</xref>). In contrast, although mice infected with the SARS-CoV-nsp1ΔD-EΔ3-p10M mutant initially lost 10% of their weight, at day 5 the mice started to regain weight, fully recovered from the disease, and 100% survived (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g015" ref-type="fig">Fig 15B</xref>). SARS-CoV-nsp1ΔD-EΔ3-p10M grew to similar titers as rSARS-CoV (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g015" ref-type="fig">Fig 15C</xref>). Nevertheless, unlike the parental virus, lungs of SARS-CoV-nsp1ΔD-EΔ3-p10M-infected mice presented no significant increase of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, no obvious lung lesions, weight increases, nor substantial inflammatory cell infiltration, as determined by macroscopic and histological examination, were observed (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 Fig</xref>). To further support the stability and attenuation of the double mutant virus, additional passages (up to 20) were conducted in mice. Evaluation of the passaged virus virulence showed that rSARS-CoV-nsp1∆D-E∆3 remained attenuated (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g015" ref-type="fig">Fig 15D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have previously shown that deletion of SARS-CoV E gene leads to an attenuated virus that is a promising vaccine candidate [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, since safety and stability are main concerns of live attenuated vaccine candidates, we focused on rSARS-CoV-∆E stability <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and on the generation of a safe vaccine candidate by identifying the mechanisms of reversion to virulence.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, serial passage of rSARS-CoV-∆E in cell culture resulted in the generation of chimeric proteins composed of a partial duplication of the membrane gene fused to a part of the leader sequence. Our results are in agreement with a recombinant MHV lacking the E protein (rMHV-∆E) that was viable but its replication was drastically impaired [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. rMHV-∆E replicated to 10,000-fold lower titers than the parental virus and remarkably, evolved similarly to SARS-CoV-∆E after serial passage in tissue culture cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Despite that the generation of a chimeric protein was previously observed in MHV when E gene was deleted [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], the presence of a PBM motif within the inserted chimeric sequence and its main role in providing genetic stability to SARS-CoV-ΔE during passage described in this manuscript, were not previously noticed. Alteration of coronavirus genome was not unexpected due to the high frequency of RNA recombination and mutation described for these viruses, both in cell culture and in animals [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p>
<p>All chimeric SARS-CoV M proteins generated in cell culture were expressed, enhancing virus growth in cell culture compared to rSARS-CoV-∆E. Similarly, rMHV-∆E that contained chimeric proteins also showed significant increases in viral yields [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In contrast, mice infected with rSARS-CoVs containing chimeric proteins generated in cell culture showed a decrease in viral titers in the lungs of infected mice even when compared with rSARS-CoV-∆E virus. Similarly, extensive passage in cell culture of other CoVs, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), led to less pathogenic strains compared to wild-type viruses, possibly due to the emergence of deletion mutants that lost sequence domain not needed for their growth in cell culture, but that influenced their tropism and <italic>in vivo</italic> replication [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Chimeric proteins containing a PBM inserted in the viral genome after passage increased viral fitness in cell culture in a tissue specific manner, i.e., the chimeric protein inserted into viral genome during passage in monkey cells promoted virus growth in cells from this species, whereas the one inserted during passage in murine cells specifically increased virus fitness in cells from mice. Furthermore, these chimeric proteins did not enhance viral growth nor virulence <italic>in vivo</italic>. These data indicated that the insertion of chimeric proteins specifically adapted the virus for an optimum growth in cell culture but did not enhance <italic>in vivo</italic> growth nor virulence. In this context, it is also important to note that the activity of PBMs is dependent on their specific sequence, and also on the sequence context in which they are inserted [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>].</p>
<p>Serial passage of rSARS-CoV-∆E in mice introduced a partial duplication of 45 nucleotides in the 8a protein, resulting in its reversion to a virulent phenotype. This phenotype was associated to its ability to activate p38 MAPK and to the induction of inflammatory cytokine expression and increased lung damage, as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p>
<p>8a protein is a short transmembrane protein composed of 39 amino acids that forms cation-selective ion channels [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. SARS-CoV variants with deletions in 8a ORF, have been transmitted and maintained in humans in the late phases of SARS-CoV epidemic [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Interestingly, an 8a protein mutant generated during virus passage <italic>in vivo</italic> contained a new potential PBM (CTTV) localized in the internal region of the carboxy-terminal domain of the protein (<xref rid="ppat.1005215.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Despite the CTVV sequence was already present in the original 8a protein, it most likely does not represent a functional PBM, as it is located within the transmembrane domain of the 8a protein. Active PBMs are in general located in exposed regions of the proteins, usually the end of the carboxy-terminus or, exceptionally, in internal positions within the carboxy-terminal domain, allowing their interaction with PDZ domains, such as it has been observed in the NS5 proteins of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Dengue virus [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. However, PBMs forming part of a transmembrane domain are not accessible to PDZ-containing proteins and have not been described [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, the new CTVV sequence placed in an exposed environment may constitute a novel and active PBM. The PBM insertion within 8a protein after passaging <italic>in vivo</italic> could be due to the fact that the ORF8 is one of the regions where most variations were observed between human and animal isolates of SARS-CoV [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In fact, a complete genome sequence of SARS-like coronaviruses in bats isolates showed the presence of a PBM within the ORF8 [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As mentioned above, species of bats are a natural host of coronaviruses closely related to those responsible for the SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>PDZ domains are among the modules most frequently involved in protein-protein interactions found in all metazoans [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In the human genome, there are more than 900 PDZ domains in at least 400 different proteins [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Many pathogenic viruses produce PDZ ligands that disrupt host protein complexes for their own benefit, such as hepatitis B virus, influenza virus, rabies virus and human immunodeficiency virus, influencing their replication, dissemination in the host, transmission and virulence [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Generation of new proteins containing a PBM after passaging in cell culture and in mice may affect their interaction with a wide range of cellular PDZ-containing proteins, affecting diverse biological functions with high relevance in pathogenesis. E protein PBM participates in two different and independent issues, virus stability and virulence. Our data suggest that when the PBM was present in a proper environment at the end of the E protein, either a native or a mutant protein, viruses remained stable. An independent observation is that the presence of a PBM within E protein confers pathogenicity to the virus [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This virulence is prevented either by PBM removal [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or by the introduction of small deletions within the carboxy-terminus of E protein [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], which by themselves may cause attenuation or, alternatively, by indirectly affecting the PBM. Our results highlighted the critical requirement of viral proteins containing a PBM in the generation of CoVs with virulent phenotypes, and opened up new approaches for the rational design of genetically stable vaccines.</p>
<p>Maintaining the attenuated phenotype of the vaccine candidate after passage <italic>in vitro</italic> was crucial to avoid the reversion to a virulent phenotype during the design and production of a genetically stable vaccine candidate. To this end, the identification of the relevance of the presence of a functional PBM motif at the carboxy-terminus of a transmembrane protein of the virus has been instrumental in the development of a stable SARS-CoV vaccine candidate. To minimize the risk of regain of virulence after passage, we engineered viruses with small deletions in E gene, instead of deletion of the entire E gene. By preserving the PBM, we observed no evidence for the development of chimeric proteins and thus no gain in virulence. As additional measures to ensure safety of this live attenuated vaccine candidate, we incorporated attenuating mutations into nsp1, in the context of the rSARS-CoV-ΔE or EΔ3. Nsp1 was chosen as a second attenuation target because this gene is located at a distant site (&gt;20 kb) from that of the E gene in the viral genome, making it very unlikely that a single recombination event with a circulating wt coronavirus could result in the restoration of a virulent phenotype.</p>
<p>To analyze the role of SARS-CoV nsp1 in the pathogenesis of the virus, recombinant viruses encoding four different small deletions were generated. Deletion of amino acids 121–129 and 154–165, in the carboxy terminal region of nsp1 led to virus attenuation, indicating that nsp1 enhanced virus pathogenicity, as was previously shown for MHV [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Interestingly, these attenuated mutants grew in mice to lower titers than rSARS-CoV, probably by inducing higher IFN responses, indicating that these regions of nsp1 are critical for IFN antagonism. The induction of a higher innate immune response by the nsp1 deletion is most probably responsible for the decrease in SARS-CoV-nsp1* virus titers observed in mice and, to a lesser extent, in DBT-mACE–2 cells. In fact, a rSARS-CoV lacking the nsp1 protein grew poorly in IFN competent cells, but replicated as efficiently as the wt virus in IFN deficient cells [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], consistent with our findings. Similarly, titers of MHV deleted in nsp1 are restored almost to wild type levels in type I IFN receptor-deficient mice [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p>
<p>Immunization with singly deleted rSARS-CoV protected mice against challenge with rSARS-CoV, as it was previously shown with MHV nsp1-deletion mutants [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. SARS-CoV-nsp1ΔD-EΔ3, which contained deletions in nsp1 and E protein, maintained its attenuated phenotype after passage in Vero E6 cells and in mice. In addition, immunization with this double mutant fully protected mice from challenge with the parental virulent virus, indicating that it is a promising vaccine candidate in terms of both stability and efficacy.</p>
<p>Both humoral and cellular responses are relevant to protect from SARS [<xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1005215.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The viruses generated in this work express all viral proteins, except for small regions deleted in the E and nsp1 proteins, therefore have the potential of inducing both antibody and T cell responses, making this type of live vaccine more attractive than subunit or non replicating virus vaccines. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which an attenuated SARS-CoV reverted to a virulent phenotype could also be applied to the development of other relevant CoVs vaccines, such as MERS-CoV.</p>
