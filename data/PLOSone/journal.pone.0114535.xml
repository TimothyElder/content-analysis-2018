<abstract>
<p>The rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line is a widely used system to study neuronal differentiation for which sustained activation of the extracellular signaling related kinase (ERK) pathway is required. Here, we investigate the function of MK-STYX [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) phosphoserine/threonine/tyrosine-binding protein] in neuronal differentiation. MK-STYX is a member of the MAPK phosphatase (MKP) family, which is generally responsible for dephosphorylating the ERKs. However, MK-STYX lacks catalytic activity due to the absence of the nucleophilic cysteine in the active site signature motif HC(X<sub>5</sub>)R that is essential for phosphatase activity. Despite being catalytically inactive, MK-STYX has been shown to play a role in important cellular pathways, including stress responses. Here we show that PC12 cells endogenously express MK-STYX. In addition, MK-STYX, but not its catalytically active mutant, induced neurite-like outgrowths in PC12 cells. Furthermore, MK-STYX dramatically increased the number of cells with neurite extensions in response to nerve growth factor (NGF), whereas the catalytically active mutant did not. MK-STYX continued to induce neurites in the presence of a MEK (MAP kinase kinase) inhibitor suggesting that MK-STYX does not act through the Ras-ERK/MAPK pathway but is involved in another pathway whose inactivation leads to neuronal differentiation. RhoA activity assays indicated that MK-STYX induced extensions through the Rho signaling pathway. MK-STYX decreased RhoA activation, whereas RhoA activation increased when MK-STYX was down-regulated. Furthermore, MK-STYX affected downstream players of RhoA such as the actin binding protein cofilin. The presence of MK-STYX decreased the phosphorylation of cofilin in non NGF stimulated cells, but increased its phosphorylation in NGF stimulated cells, whereas knocking down MK-STYX caused an opposite effect. Taken together our data suggest that MK-STYX may be a regulator of RhoA signaling, and implicate this pseudophosphatase as a regulator of neuronal differentiation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>PC12 cells serve as a model for neuronal cell differentiation because they differentiate in response to neurotrophins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Greene1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Dixon1">[4]</xref>. Moreover, they respond to nerve growth factor (NGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) differently. While both growth factors require Ras activation to stimulate the ERK/MAPK (extracellular regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Qiu1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Qui1">[6]</xref>, NGF induces a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype, while EGF promotes proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Vaudry1">[7]</xref>. The differential response in PC12 cells is widely accepted to be due to differences in the duration of MAPK activation. NGF causes sustained activation of MAPK, implying sustained MAPK phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Keegan1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Grewal1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Traverse1">[10]</xref>, whereas EGF causes transient activation, implying rapid dephosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Traverse2">[11]</xref>-. Numerous studies support a model in which sustained MAPK activation is required for neuronal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Sun1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-MisraPress1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Wishart1">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, sustained MAPK activation is well characterized as an inducer of neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Traverse1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Pang1">[14]</xref>. However, the mechanisms of PC12 neuronal differentiation are incompletely understood. Other signaling pathways, such as the Rho/ROCK (RhoA kinase) pathway, have been implicated in PC12 differentiation as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Keegan1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Katoh1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Kondratyev1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>The duration and extent of MAPK activation depends on the activity of both kinases and phosphatases that regulate MAPK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Keyse1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hornberg1">[20]</xref>. Most MAPKs are substrates for members of the dual specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases that hydrolyze phospho-serine, -threonine, and -tyrosine residues on MAPK, and thus are termed MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Sun1">[21]</xref>. The protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is required for Ras and MAPK activation and neuronal outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hadari1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Easton1">[23]</xref>. Furthermore, the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK by MKPs plays an important role in ERK signaling in both time and space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Bluthgen1">[24]</xref>. Three MKPs, MKP-1, MKP-2, and MKP-3, have been implicated in neuronal differentiation and are expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell types, including PC12 cells. Intriguingly, both EGF and NGF elicit a rapid increase in MKP-1 and MKP-2 mRNAs levels in PC12 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-MisraPress1">[25]</xref>, whereas only NGF induces a rapid increase in MKP-3 mRNA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Camps1">[26]</xref>. Although all three MKPs inhibit MAPK activation, MKP-3 has been studied more extensively in neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-MisraPress1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Wu1">[27]</xref>. MKP-3 is significantly up-regulated and sustained for five days in PC12 cells stimulated by NGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Camps1">[26]</xref>, and is a known regulator of the duration of MAPK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Owens1">[28]</xref>. However, this does not address whether the rapid production of MKP leads to the transient MAPK response to EGF.</p>
<p>The prototypical catalytically inactive pseudophosphatase, STYX (serine threonine tyrosine interacting protein), has a glycine residue at the position expected for the active-site cysteine residue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Wishart1">[29]</xref>. Initially it was proposed that STYX represented a new class of pSer/pThr/pTyr-binding proteins that function as dominant negative antagonists of endogenous protein phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Wishart2">[30]</xref>. STYX associates with the spermatid phosphoprotein CRHSP-24 (calcium-responsive heat-stable protein with a molecular mass of 24k Da), which is a unique RNA binding protein. STYX knockout mice are defective for sperm production, revealing an essential function in spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Wishart3">[31]</xref>. During neuronal differentiation, STYX competes with MKP-2 for binding to ERK1/2 MAPKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Reiterer1">[32]</xref>. Moreover, it reduces activation of ERK1/2 MAPK and, thereby, blocks PC12 differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Reiterer1">[32]</xref>. Considering that STYX is not a member of the MKP family, its role in the ERK signaling pathway was unexpected. In fact the interaction between STYX and ERK signaling was pursued only because of computational modeling based on the ERK/MAPK activation by MEK (MAP kinase kinase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Reiterer1">[32]</xref>. Thus, we asked what would be the role of a pseudophosphatase that is a member of the MKP family in neuronal differentiation?</p>
<p>The pseudophosphatase MK-STYX is a product of the <italic>DUSP24</italic> gene, which has homology to the <italic>MKP-3</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Tonks1">[33]</xref>. However, MK-STYX is a unique member of the MKP family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hinton1">[34]</xref>. The active site signature motif <bold>HC</bold>(X<sub>5</sub>)<bold>R</bold> is essential for phosphatase activity, but MK-STYX has the sequence I<bold><underline>FS</underline></bold>TQGIS<bold>R</bold>S, which renders it catalytically inactive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Wishart2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Tonks1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hinton1">[34]</xref>. Mutations made in MK-STYX that restore this signature motif generate an active phosphatase (MK-STYX<sub>active</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hinton1">[34]</xref>. Despite being catalytically inactive, MK-STYX plays a role in a number of important cellular pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hinton1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Siligan1">[36]</xref>, including inhibition of apoptosis and stress granule formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hinton1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Niemi1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Barr1">[37]</xref>. The functionality of MK-STYX is underexplored and still remains elusive; however, as with active MKP homologs, determining its interaction partners has helped elucidate some of the functions of MK-STYX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hinton1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Niemi2">[38]</xref>. In earlier studies concerning the cellular function of MK-STYX, we discovered that it binds G3BP-1 (Ras-GTPase activating protein SH3 domain binding protein-1), which regulates both the Ras signaling pathway and stress granule assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Greene1">[1]</xref>. We determined that MK-STYX inhibits stress granule formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hinton1">[34]</xref>. Dephosphorylation of G3BP-1 at Ser149 is critical for stress granule formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Tourriere1">[39]</xref>; however, MK-STYX's interaction with G3BP-1 and its effect on the stress granule pathway is independent of the phosphorylation status of Ser 149 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Barr1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Given the apparent role of STYX in MAPK activation, this study focused on the role of MK-STYX in PC12 cell differentiation. Opposite to the effects of STYX, MK-STYX, but not the catalytically active mutant, induced neurite-like outgrowths. MK-STYX dramatically increased the number of cells with neurite extensions in response to NGF, whereas MK-STYX<sub>active</sub> decreased the number of cells with extensions. MK-STYX continued to induce neurites in the presence of a MEK inhibitor. These data suggest that MK-STYX does not function through the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway like STYX does, confirming previous findings in our lab, and a report that MK-STYX has no effect on ERK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Niemi1">[35]</xref>. Rather, we show that MK-STYX induced extensions through the Rho signaling pathway. MK-STYX overexpression decreased RhoA activation, and RhoA activation increased when MK-STYX was down-regulated, Moreover, MK-STYX effected downstream targets such as cofilin, which has a major role in actin filament networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Elam1">[40]</xref>. MK-STYX decreased cofilin phosophorylation in non-stimulated cells, but increased cofilin phosphorylation 24 hours after NGF stimulation. Taken together, our data provide evidence that MK-STYX acts as a regulator in the Rho signaling pathway and neuronal differentiation.</p>

<title>Cell Culture and Transient Transfection</title>
<p>PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma) cells (ATCC) were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Roswell Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium (Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Invitrogen) and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) or high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. Using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), cells were transfected with expression plasmids pMT2, pMT2-FLAG-MK-STYX-FLAG, or pMT2-FLAG-MK-STYX<sub>active</sub>-FLAG and pEGFP. Cells were either not stimulated or stimulated with nerve growth factor (NGF), or treated with a MEK inhibitor for the subsequent experiments, and analyzed with fluorescence microscopy.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Live Cell Imaging and Scoring Cells</title>
<p>Cells were seeded at 1.5×10<sup>5</sup> cells in a 60 mm dish (Fisher) and transfected 16 or 24 hr post seeding. Live cell imaging of EGFP-expressing cells was conducted with phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy using a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti inverted fluorescence microscope. Cells were observed over a five day period. Cells were scored either day 3 or 5 post-treatment for “neurites,” defined as neurite-like outgrowths ≧20 µm in length. Cells were scored at least by day 3, when the outgrowths were clearly visible. Neurite outgrowth length was measured with NIS-Elements Basic Research software (version 3.10, Nikon). At least three replicate transfections were performed and at least 100 cells were scored per replicate. Samples were scored blind with regard to treatment and were scored independently by at least two different individuals. Cells were scored into two categories: no neurites and neurites, except for the initial experiments where cells were categorized as &lt;20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, 80–100, 100+ µm. Since this experiment showed neurite extensions longer than 20 µm to be characteristic of differentiation, subsequent studies focused on cells producing extensions &gt;20 µm.</p>

<title>NGF Stimulation</title>
<p>Twenty-four hr post-transfection, PC12 cells were serum-starved in RPMI supplemented with 1% horse serum or DMEM with no serum for 8–12 hr and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml of NGF (Prospec). For time-dependent NGF stimulation, cells were lysed at 0 min, 1 min, 3 min, 5 min, 12 min, 30 min, 24 hr, and 48 hr.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>PC12 cells were transfected with pMT2-FLAG-MK-STYX-FLAG, or MK-STYX specific shRNA expression plasmids, lysed, and analyzed by western blotting. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40 alternative [Calbiochem], and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets [Roche]). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000×g for 10 min, and the supernatant protein concentration was determined by NanoDrop quantification. Lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE or 12% SDS-PAGE (cofilin experiments) and transferred to PVDF membrane by iBlot (Invitrogen) for immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-STYXL1 (antibody against MK-STYX, Sigma), phospho-cofilin (Cell Signaling), cofilin (Cell Signaling) or anti-ß tubulin (Pierce) antibodies, followed by chemiluminescent detection. When warranted, blots were stripped (200 mM glycine, 3.5 mM SDS, 1% Tween 20), and re-probed.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>MK-STYX Knockdown</title>
<p>Control or MK-STYX-specific shRNA expression plasmids (Qiagen) were transfected into PC12 cells for 24 hr. RNA was isolated from the cells with RNAzol (MRC). cDNA synthesis was performed with RT<sup>2</sup> First Strand Kit (Qiagen), and real time PCR was performed with RT<sup>2</sup> SYBER Green ROX qPCR Mastermix (Qiagen) and RT<sup>2</sup> qPCR Primer Assay [primers specific for STYXL1 (MK-STYX)] (Qiagen). Gene expression was tracked in real time using the Applied Biosystems StepOne Real-Time PCR-System. Triplicates were performed to determine the optimal amount of MK-STYX shRNA. Knockdown was also further analyzed by immunoblotting. Twenty-four hr post-transfection cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml NGF and analyzed for neurite outgrowth.</p>

<title>MK-STYX induces neurite outgrowth formation in PC12 cells</title>
<p>Since we previously identified G3BP-1 as an interacting binding partner of MK-STYX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hinton1">[34]</xref>, and another pseudophosphatase, STYX, inhibits PC12 cell differentiation, we sought to determine whether MK-STYX has an effect on neuronal signaling by using PC12 cells as the model. To determine whether MK-STYX induces or inhibits neurite formation, PC12 cells were transfected with pEGFP and pMT2, MK-STYX, or MK-STYX<sub>active</sub> and observed for neurite outgrowth. By day 5, the results were striking; cells transfected with MK-STYX and pEGFP developed neurites, whereas those transfected with MK-STYX<sub>active</sub>, pMT2 or pEGFP did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114535-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Significantly more of the cells transfected with MK-STYX and pEGFP (∼55%) had neurites, as compared to control cells expressing the empty pMT2 and pEGFP vectors (∼22%) or pEGFP alone (∼25%) (ANOVA: F<sub>2,8</sub> = 76.10, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114535-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

<title>MK-STYX enhances the effects of NGF</title>
<p>To determine the PC12 outgrowth lengths, cells were imaged and the extensions were measured from the body to the end as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114535-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, where the neurite-like outgrowth measured was 172.5 µm. As the standard in subsequent experiments, an outgrowth ≧20 µm was considered to be a neurite-like outgrowth. To analyze MK-STYX's effects on normal cellular signaling in response to growth factors further, we stimulated cells co-expressing pEGFP and pMT2 or MK-STYX with NGF. NGF caused neurite extension in all cells, but MK-STYX shifted the distribution to much longer outgrowths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114535-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, to determine the effects of MK-STYX specific expression plasmids, cells were transfected with various clones. Cells transfected with MK-STYX shRNA Clone A (MK-STYX shRNA-A) or Clone C (MK-STYX shRNA-C) showed the greatest knockdown of MK-STYX mRNA levels, at 42% and 32%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114535-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), as well as knockdown of protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114535-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). To determine the importance of MK-STYX in neurite outgrowths in PC12 cells, cells were transfected with shRNAs against MK-STYX, stimulated with NGF, and observed for neurite outgrowths. Eighty two percent of cells expressing the scrambled shRNA negative control had neurite outgrowths.

<title>MK-STYX affects RhoA downstream target cofilin</title>
<p>Since we showed that MK-STYX inactivates RhoA, the question arose whether MK-STYX has an effect on downstream targets of RhoA. To address this question we analyzed phosphorylation of cofilin, an actin binding protein that is regulated by RhoA. Cells were transfected with MK-STYX, scrambled control, or MK-STYX shRNA-A and either stimulated with NGF for 24 hr or not. Cofilin phosphorylation decreased in cells over-expressing MK-STYX or scrambled control in unstimulated cells, compared with the levels of phospho-cofilin present shRNA-A-expressing cells. However, 24 hr post NGF stimulation, cofilin phosphorylation increased in cells over-expressing MK-STYX. Taken together, these data suggest that MK-STYX may play an important role in cofilin activation and inactivation, and in the actin filament network.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is an abundant population of human pseudoenzymes within the kinase and phosphatase families that may play key roles in signaling cascades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Tonks2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Boudeau1">[46]</xref>. Yet, nearly two decades after the discovery of the prototypical pseudophosphatase, STYX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Wishart1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Wishart2">[30]</xref>, little is known about the functions or molecular mechanisms of the majority of the pseudophosphatases. The <italic>C. elegans</italic> EGG pseudophosphatases serve as the best mechanistic examples; EGG4 and EGG5 bind and regulate signaling through the dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and -regulated kinase family mini brain kinase 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Tonks2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Cheng1">[47]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that MK-STYX is a master regulator of apoptotic potential of the mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Niemi1">[35]</xref>. Knockdown of MK-STYX blocks release of cytochrome c, and prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Niemi1">[35]</xref>. Recently, a model was provided for the molecular mechanism by which MK-STYX controls apoptosis, suggesting that MK-STYX negatively regulates PTPM1 (PTP localized to the mitochondrion 1). MK-STYX interacts with PTPM1 and inhibits its catalytic activity, regulating cell viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Niemi2">[38]</xref>. Such interactions between a pseudophosphatase and an active phosphatase are also seen among the myotubularin phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Niemi2">[38]</xref>. However, binding of the myotubularin pseudophosphatase to its active homolog enhances phosphatase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Begley1">[48]</xref>. Previously, we reported that MK-STYX has a role in the stress response pathway by inhibiting stress granule formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hinton1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Barr1">[37]</xref>. In this study, we report that it is important for neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and decreases RhoA activation.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that pseudophosphatases serve a “dominant-negative” function by physically masking the phosphorylated residues, thereby blocking access of phosphatases, and protecting substrates from dephosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Tonks2">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Tonks3">[49]</xref>. Thus, it seemed plausible that a pseudophosphatase might have a role in sustaining the MAPK activation required for PC12 neuronal differentiation. Findings with STYX have shown that this pseudophosphatase competes with MKP-2 to bind ERK1/2 MAPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Reiterer1">[32]</xref>; however, STYX's interaction with ERK1/2 MAPK is much more dynamic than merely serving as a blocker. STYX acts as a nuclear anchor for ERK1/2 MAPK, thereby regulating its activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Reiterer1">[32]</xref>. Furthermore, over-expression of STYX prevents PC12 differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Reiterer1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast, we show that over-expressing MK-STYX induces neurite-like outgrowths, a hallmark of PC12 differentiation. In addition to inducing outgrowths, when cells expressing MK-STYX were stimulated with NGF, longer neurites formed and more branching occurred, suggesting these cells are becoming neuronal. By analogy with the STYX results, we thought that MK-STYX might exert its effects on PC12 differentiation through the Ras-ERK/MAPK pathway. However, our studies with the MEK inhibitor provide evidence that MK-STYX does not function through Ras-ERK/MAPK, but further downstream or by another pathway. Furthermore, we have observed that MK-STYX does not have an effect on Ras activation in the presence or absence of NGF (unpublished observations). Other studies have reported that NGF-dependent survival of PC12 cells may be mediated by other pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Sasaki1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Yao1">[51]</xref>. Here, we show that MK-STYX is involved in the RhoA signaling pathway, which also has been implicated in PC12 neuronal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Sebok1">[16]</xref>. Further support for a role of MK-STYX in the RhoA signaling pathway comes from the branching out pattern seen in the presence of MK-STYX and NGF. This branching out pattern may represent the formation of dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Atlas1">[52]</xref>, which are important for neuronal communication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Jan1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hausser1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Dotti1">[54]</xref>. Furthermore, these extensions appear to overlap, suggesting that MK-STYX may have a role in branching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Jan1">[41]</xref>, which is regulated by the Rho GTPases.</p>
<p>In addition, MK-STYX affected the RhoA downstream target cofilin, Cofilin has a dual role in the actin filament network, to depolymerize and/or sever actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Bamburg1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Samstag1">[56]</xref>. When phosphorylated, cofilin is inactive, resulting in filament stability, whereas dephosphorylation of cofilin leads to depolymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Samstag1">[56]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Moriyama1">[58]</xref> Thus, cofilin is a modulator of the actin cytoskeleton architecture, and plays a pivotal role in the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton that is required for neuronal differentiation. We demonstrate that MK-STYX decreased cofilin phosphorylation in the absence of NGF, which is required for the induction of neurites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Zhang1">[59]</xref>. However, MK-STYX increased cofilin phosphorylation 24 hr post- NGF stimulation, similar to the commitment period of PC12 cells to become neuronal and begin branching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Jeon1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Liu1">[44]</xref>. This supports the effects of MK-STYX on RhoA activation beyond the 24 hr NGF stimulation, providing more substantial evidence that MK-STYX has a role in RhoA signaling.</p>
<p>The Rho family of small GTPases has been implicated in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and subsequent morphological changes in various cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hall1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Kaibuchi1">[61]</xref>. Rho family members serve as molecular switches by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. At least two members within this family, RhoA and RhoE, have been reported to have important roles in PC12 neurite extension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-TalensVisconti1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Jeon2">[63]</xref>. RhoE causes neurite outgrowths in PC12 cells by inhibiting the RhoA/ROCK-1 (Rho kinase) signaling cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-TalensVisconti1">[62]</xref>, and RhoA inactivation is essential for PC12 neurite outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Jeon2">[63]</xref>. Our results have revealed a new component in the RhoA signaling pathway. We demonstrate here that MK-STYX decreases RhoA activation, while down-regulation of MK-STYX increases RhoA activation. Considering that G3BP-1, the first identified binding partner of MK-STYX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Hinton1">[34]</xref>, has been implicated to have a role in Rho signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Zhang2">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Pazman1">[65]</xref>, MK-STYX may be an important regulator in this pathway. Furthermore, G3BP-1 also interacts with other macromolecules such as tau mRNA and has been implicated in differentiation of neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Atlas1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Martin1">[66]</xref>. Important future studies include determining whether the neurite-like outgrowths induced by MK-STYX differentiate into neurons, further analyzing MK-STYX's effects on branching, its molecular mechanism in PC12 differentiation, and the mechanism by which MK-STYX inhibits Rho activation. For example, MK-STYX may interact with the low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP), p190GAP, or RhoA to inhibit its activity and induce neurite formation. There are several unanswered questions. However, pseudophosphatases have been shown to regulate phosphatase activity positively or negatively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Niemi2">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Begley1">[48]</xref>. Furthermore, MK-STYX could directly interact with RhoA, preventing its association with the membrane and rendering it inactive.</p>
<p>Various kinases and phosphatases have been implicated in controlling neuronal development and regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Buchser1">[67]</xref>. Moreover, it is becoming apparent that pseudokinases and pseudophosphatases are integral elements of signal transduction, and thus may exert important roles in the pathology of various diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0114535-Reiterer2">[68]</xref>. Although STYX was the first pseudophosphatase implicated in having a role in PC12 cell differentiation by regulating ERK1/2 activation, the present study provides the first evidence that MK-STYX has an effect very different from that of STYX in this process. Over-expression of MK-STYX resulted in PC12 cell differentiation, and knocking down MK-STYX prevented neurite formation, suggesting that the pseudophosphatase plays an important role in PC12 cell differentiation. However, MK-STYK differs from STYX's role as an ERK1/2 regulator, in that MK-STYX bypasses Ras-ERK/MAPK signaling or functions through another pathway. The precise mechanism underlying the effects of MK-STYX remains to be defined; however, results from this study support a mode of action of MK-STYX through the RhoA signaling pathway. Further characterization of the role of MK-STYX in neuronal cells may generate new insights into neuronal development and potential approaches to therapy for neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Alzheimer's.</p>
