<abstract>
<p><italic>Vaccinia</italic>-H1 Related (VHR) dual-specificity phosphatase, or DUSP3, plays an important role in cell cycle regulation and its expression is altered in several human cancers. In mouse model, DUSP3 deletion prevents neo-angiogenesis and b-FGF-induced microvessel outgrowth. Considering the importance of angiogenesis in metastasis formation, our study aimed to investigate the role of DUSP3 in tumour cell dissemination. Using a Lewis Lung carcinoma (LLC) experimental metastasis model, we observed that DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice developed larger lung metastases than littermate controls. DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> bone marrow transfer to lethally irradiated DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice was sufficient to transfer the phenotype to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice, indicating that hematopoietic cells compartment was involved in the increased tumour cell dissemination to lung tissues. Interestingly, we found a higher percentage of tumour-promoting Ly6C<sup>int</sup> macrophages in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> LLC-bearing lung homogenates that was at least partially due to a better recruitment of these cells. This was confirmed by 1) the presence of higher number of the Ly6B<sup>hi</sup> macrophages in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> lung homogenates and by 2) the better migration of DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> bone marrow sorted monocytes, peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs), compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> monocytes, macrophages and BMDMs, in response to LLC-conditioned medium. Our study demonstrates that DUSP3 phosphatase plays a key role in metastatic growth through a mechanism involving the recruitment of macrophages towards LLC-bearing lungs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DUSP3, or <italic>Vaccinia</italic> <underline>H</underline>1-<underline>R</underline>elated (VHR), is a member of the atypical dual-specificity protein phosphatase family (A-DUSPs). This protein contains a 185 amino acids (Mr 21 kDa) catalytic domain and lacks targeting or docking domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref001">1</xref>]. Its shallow and broad catalytic pocket allows DUSP3 to dephosphorylate both p-tyrosine (p-Tyr) and p-threonine (p-Thr) residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref002">2</xref>]. The MAPKs ERK1/2, JNK and to a lesser extend p38 have been reported as substrates of DUSP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref006">6</xref>]. The phosphatase also dephosphorylates other proteins such as the transcription factor STAT5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref007">7</xref>] and tyrosine kinase receptors EGFR and ErbB2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref008">8</xref>]. DUSP3 expression is regulated during cell cycle progression. Indeed its downregulation using RNA interference contributed to arrest HeLa cells in G1/S and G2/M phases and triggered their senescence. This was correlated with the hyper-phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref009">9</xref>]. Consequently, it is not surprising that overexpression of DUSP3 was found in human cervix carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref010">10</xref>] and prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref011">11</xref>]. However, DUSP3 is also downregulated in other cancers such as breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref012">12</xref>] and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref013">13</xref>], indicating contradictory and complex roles of DUSP3 in cancer development.</p>
<p>Recently, we generated full knock-out DUSP3-deficient (DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup>) mice by homologous recombination. These mice are viable, healthy and fertile, with no spontaneous phenotype. However, in these mice, DUSP3 deficiency prevented neo-angiogenesis and b-FGF-induced microvessel outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>In solid tumours, host cells such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts and immune cells represent a major part of cell populations within the tumour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref015">15</xref>]. Macrophages are the most frequent immune cells in the tumour and their presence is mostly correlated with poor prognosis for the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref017">17</xref>]. These macrophages are called tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) and regulate many, if not all stages of tumour progression from initiation of tumour development to metastatic dissemination including invasion, migration and extravasation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref018">18</xref>]. Indeed TAM control the induction of angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodelling, the stimulation of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis and the inhibition of anti-tumour immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref019">19</xref>]. TAM subpopulations are very heterogeneous and have different phenotypes. Hence, they can execute multiple and different functions related to tumour growth and reside in distinct areas within the tumour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>TAMs are shaped by factors secreted by tumour cells or by the tumour microenvironment to become immunosuppressive macrophages and exert pro-tumour responses. Indeed in addition to their trophic functions, TAMs are usually unable to lyse tumour cells, present tumour-associated antigens to T cells and express immune-stimulatory cytokines to stimulate the proliferation of anti-tumour functions of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, it has been proposed that TAMs are polarized into a M2-like phenotype (or alternatively activated-like macrophages) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref021">21</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this polarization are, however, poorly understood.</p>
<p>In this study, using a Lewis Lung carcinoma (LLC)-experimental metastasis model and DUSP3-deficient mice, we reported that the phosphatase DUSP3 is a key player in metastatic growth, modulating the recruitment of macrophages towards LLC-bearing lungs.</p>

<title>DUSP3 deletion accelerates experimental LLC and E0771, but not B16, metastatic growth</title>
<p>We have previously shown that DUSP3 plays an important role in tumour neo-vascularisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref014">14</xref>]. We showed that matrigel plugs and LLC subcutaneous tumours were less vascularized in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> littermates. To investigate more in depth the roles of DUSP3 in experimental metastasis formation, we intravenously injected 1x10<sup>6</sup> LLC-luciferase (LLC) cells into age and sex-matched DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. LLC metastatic growth was followed <italic>in vivo</italic> by LLC cell luminescence signal quantification using the <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging system IVIS 200. Remarkably, the incidence of LLC lung metastasis was significantly higher in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). At the time of sacrifice (day 14 after LLC injection), the DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> metastatic lung weight was significantly increased compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Photographs of the lungs showed a major metastatic development in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> lungs while only few nodules were visible in DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Haematoxylin-eosin staining of lung sections and tumour area quantification confirmed that DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> lung tumours were significantly larger than in DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>).</p>

<p>To verify whether the marked increase of LLC growth in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice was tumour model-dependent, we challenged DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> with two additional metastatic cells such as melanoma B16-F10-luciferase (B16) cells and E0771 cells. For B16, tumour growth was monitored using IVIS 200. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the number and frequency of B16 metastatic foci between DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. This was supported by the weight of B16-bearing DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> lungs and haematoxylin-eosin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Since E0771 cells do not express luciferase, tumour growth was evaluated at the time of sacrifice (14 days after cells injection) of the animals. Similarly to LLC cells, photographs of the lungs, weight of lungs, haematoxylin-eosin staining showed a significant metastatic development in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> lungs while only few nodules were visible in DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<title>LLC metastasis growth in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice is driven by bone marrow derived cells</title>
<p>Lung carcinomas are highly infiltrated with heterogeneous myeloid cell populations; among which some display a more tumour-promoting than others, although their precursors seem to be the same [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref022">22</xref>]. In a previous study, we showed that DUSP3 deletion in mice was associated with a polarization of macrophages towards the M2-like phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref023">23</xref>]. Since this cell population has been shown to play an important role in tumour promotion, we hypothesized that macrophages might be key actors in the enhanced LLC tumour cell dissemination observed in the LLC experimental model. Since DUSP3 knockout mice were generated using the standard homologous recombination method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref014">14</xref>], we first generated chimeric mice by bone marrow (BM) transplantation of bone marrow cells from DUSP3<sup>-/—</sup>C57BL/6-CD45.2 mice to lethally irradiated DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup>-C57BL/6-CD45.1 mice (DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup>→DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice). Successful hemato-lymphoid reconstitution was verified by flow cytometry for the recipient mice 3–4 weeks after transplantation (data not shown) and by anti-DUSP3 immunoblot of spleen lysates at the day of sacrifice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). As a control, DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup>-C57BL/6-CD45.1 mice were transplanted with DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup>-C57BL/6-CD45.2 BM cells (DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup>→DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice). The obtained chimeric mice were then i.v. challenged with 1x10<sup>6</sup> LLC cells. Lung metastasis development was monitored for 2 weeks after tumour cell injection, by measuring luciferase activity of tumour cells. Interestingly, DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice adoptively transferred with DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> bone marrow cells (DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup>→DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice) displayed an increased luciferase activity in lungs compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup>→DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> transferred mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). A significant correlation was measured between DUSP3 protein expression and the LLC bioluminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Moreover lung weight and lung tumour area were significantly higher in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup>→DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup>→DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g004">Fig 4E–4G</xref>) suggesting that DUSP3-deficient hematopoietic cells contribute to enhance LLC tumour aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p>

<p>To further assess which hematopoietic cell populations could be involved in the increased tumour aggressiveness, we analysed, in first instance, by flow cytometry, the myeloid cell subsets present in established DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> lung homogenates bearing LLC tumours. The gating strategy is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185786.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. Briefly, after gating on CD45<sup>+</sup> and CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells to select myeloid cells, neutrophils, eosinophils and alveolar macrophages were discriminated based on Ly6G and Siglec-F surface markers. Macrophages/monocytes were considered Ly6G<sup>-</sup>siglecF<sup>-</sup> and with various expression of Ly6C and MHC-II as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref024">24</xref>]. The percentage of CD45.2 and CD11b positive cells was higher in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup>lung homogenates compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> (data not shown). The percentage of neutrophils was significantly higher in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> lungs compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup>. On the contrary, the percentage of eosinophils, alveolar macrophages and monocytes remained unchanged in DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> lungs. However, the absolute number of eosinophils and monocytes/macrophages were significantly higher in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> lungs compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup>. The number of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages was slightly but not significantly elevated in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). We next characterized the different monocyte/macrophage subpopulations within LLC-bearing lungs based on Ly6C and MHC-II expression together with CD206, F4/80 and Ly6B markers. In DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> metastatic lungs, only 10% of macrophages were Ly6B<sup>hi</sup>, while about 20% and 65% of cells were Ly6B<sup>int</sup> and Ly6B<sup>low</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>). On the opposite, the percentage of Ly6B<sup>hi</sup> and Ly6B<sup>int</sup> macrophages were significantly increased in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice with more than 20% and 30% among the MHC-II positive cells, respectively. The DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> Ly6B<sup>low</sup> cells were significantly decreased compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). The expression of F4/80, Ly6C and CD206 on these populations confirmed the identity of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). As a control, Ly6B expression was measured on B16-tumor bearing lungs but no difference was found between DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages (supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185786.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>A potential explanation for the higher presence of recently migrated Ly6B<sup>hi</sup> cells in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice could be that soluble factors secreted by LLC enhance the migration of these cells.

For BMMs, differences were similar and already visible and significant after only 1h 30 min of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). As a control, we performed the same <italic>in vitro</italic> migration assay in response to B16-conditioned medium (B16-CM).

<title>Macrophage depletion reduces LLC tumour growth in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice</title>
<p>Together, the obtained data suggest that myeloid cells, and in particular macrophages, accelerate LLC lung tumour progression by a mechanism involving the phosphatase DUSP3. To confirm this finding, we chemically depleted macrophages in DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice, using clodronate-liposomes. Mice were first intravenously and intraperitoneally injected with clodronate-liposomes or with empty-liposomes as control. 48 hours after the first injection of liposomes, mice were intravenously injected with 1x10<sup>6</sup> LLC cells, after which the intraperitoneal injection of clodronate-liposomes was repeated every other day and up to two weeks after LLC challenge. Finally, the lung metastasis formation was monitored, using in vivo imaging. The efficiency of macrophage depletion was verified at the day of sacrifice by comparing the presence of residual macrophages in both peritoneal exudates and lung cell suspensions of empty-liposome versus clodronate-liposome injected mice. In peritoneal exudates, CD11b<sup>+</sup>-F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages completely disappeared after clodronate-liposome injection. In lung homogenates, one population of Ly6B<sup>hi</sup> macrophages was significantly reduced after clodronate-liposome injection compared to control conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185786.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Compared to vehicle liposome-treated mice, elimination of macrophages decreased significantly LLC metastatic dissemination in both DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice as demonstrated by the decreased bioluminescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>), weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g007">Fig 7C</xref>) and tumor area in lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g007">Fig 7D and 7E</xref>).

<title>Increased infiltration of macrophages in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice lungs is associated with increased in situ proliferation of LLC cells</title>
<p>Several studies have demonstrated that the density of TAMs positively correlates with tumor growth. Although the mechanisms are poorly understood, it has been demonstrated that TAMs secrete several factors that contribute to immunosupresion, stimulate tumor cells proliferation, promote angiogenesis and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref018">18</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref019">19</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref025">25</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref026">26</xref>]. To investigate the impact of the observed increased infiltration of macrophages in LLC, we hypothesised that DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages may increase the <italic>in situ</italic> proliferation of LLC cells. We therefore quantified proliferating tumour cells using anti-Ki67 on lungs sections from DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> and DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> tumours bearing mice.

<title>Mice and ethic statement</title>
<p>C57BL/6 (CD45.2)-DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice were generated at the University of Liege SPF animal facility as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref014">14</xref>]. These mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6-CD45.2 mice from Charles River (Charles River) to generate heterozygotes that were mated to generate DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> littermate colonies used for experimentation. Age matched female DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice were used in all the experiments. Mice were kept in ventilated cages under 12-hour dark/12-hour light cycle in the University of Liege SPF animal facility and received food and water and libitum. Health status was evaluated every 3 months and mice were always found free of specific pathogens.</p>
<p>All mice experiments and procedures were carried out following the guidelines of and in agreement with the animal ethics committee of the University of Liège (agreement Number: 858). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. Animals were monitored continuously for signs of distress or pain by FELASA-qualified personal (categories B and C) in accordance with the European guidelines for the care and maintenance of laboratory animals. After tumour cells injection, monitoring for animal health was performed every day until the mice sacrifice at day 14 post-injection. Animals were weighted twice a week. <italic>In vivo</italic> xenogen imaging was used to evaluate tumour development and progression and was performed twice, at day 7 and 14 after cells injection. Since tumours were internal, we were not able to measure the progression of tumour size. Assessment of severity was evaluated by a monitoring scheme including careful observation of any abnormal animal posture, locomotion, activity, behavior and weight loss exceeding 20%. During this study none of the animals displayed symptoms of suffering or reached the termination criteria (weight loss &gt; 20%, hunched posture, decreased activity/locomotion, agitation and abnormal aggressiveness).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Metastasis is the primary cause of death in cancer patients. The mechanisms underlying metastasis development are however not yet completely understood. Several DUSPs have been associated with metastasis formation and their expression/activity correlates with poor clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref028">28</xref>]. Most scientific studies investigating the roles of DUSPs in metastasis formation focused on tumour themselves, while only few studies analysed the roles of DUSPs in the tumour microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref029">29</xref>]. Using a recently developed DUSP3 full-knockout mouse strain and a model of experimental LLC-metastasis, shortcutting primary tumour growth and intravasation processes, we report that DUSP3 deficiency favours LLC-induced macrophage recruitment at the tumour site, thus enhancing pulmonary metastasis formation. This study highlights a new role for DUSP3 in the susceptibility to develop lung metastasis.</p>
<p>In the present work, we demonstrate that LLC-lung metastasis formation is enhanced in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> littermates. This phenomenon was however specific to LLC and E0771 cells since no difference of B16 metastatic dissemination was observed between DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Studies have reported that reduced vascular permeability led to a decrease in metastasis after LLC and B16 i.v. injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref031">31</xref>]. Although vascular permeability is significantly enhanced in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice when compared with DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice (unpublished observations), the fact that B16-induced metastasis was not influenced by DUSP3 deletion rules out the possible involvement of vascular permeability in the observed phenotype. The second plausible premise could be that LLC and E0771-metastatic cells respond differently to the DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> tumour microenvironment. A differential regulation of experimental LLC and B16 metastasis formation has been previously shown in Nrf2-deficient mice. Indeed these mice developed lung metastasis faster compared to control mice upon LLC but not B16 cells i.v. injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref032">32</xref>]. In the case of LLC metastasis, tumour formation was associated with a higher recruitment of immune cells (MDSC). The authors of the study concluded that Nrf2 facilitates appropriate immune responses against LLC cells and therefore plays an anti-metastatic role and that the phenotype was restricted to the lung microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref032">32</xref>]. The differential involvement and regulation of immune cells was further confirmed by the fact that the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and dendritic cells are different in LLC and B16 experimental metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref033">33</xref>]. In our model, the role of immune cells was clearly demonstrated by the use of bone marrow chimeric mice. The transplantation of DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> bone marrow cells into irradiated DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice accelerated the development of metastatic in recipient mice since DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> -&gt; DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice developed significantly larger lung metastasis compared to control mice, demonstrating that the hematopoietic compartment is responsible for the increased LLC metastasis in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p>
<p>We recently reported that DUSP3 plays an important role in innate immunity and most precisely in macrophages. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) display in general M2-like properties, although a high diversity exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref025">25</xref>]. Based on this knowledge, macrophages could play a role in the present LLC metastasis model by creating a tumour-sustaining environment. Specific elimination of macrophages using clodronate-liposomes decreased LLC-metastasis in both DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. More importantly, macrophage depletion abolished the difference of lung tumour growth between DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Moreover, in this experiment, we did not observe any decrease of neutrophil percentage, as verified by flow cytometry staining. This experiment rules out the involvement of neutrophils in the observed phenotype, despite the fact that a higher percentage of these cells was found in LLC-bearing lungs from DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. It would be interesting to investigate the significance of such increase and the exact role of neutrophils in LLC-metastasis formation in a DUSP3-dependent manner.</p>
<p>In a subcutaneous model of LLC tumour growth, Movahedi et al. showed that distinct subsets of monocytes/macrophages existed inside the tumour. They characterized the different monocyte/macrophage populations based on the expression of CD11b, Ly6C and MHC-II surface markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref024">24</xref>]. We performed a similar analysis on tumour-bearing lung cell suspensions of DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Phenotypically, DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> monocytes/macrophages did not differ from each other. However, using the additional marker Ly6B, known to be a marker of bone marrow recruited immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref035">35</xref>], we found a higher percentage of Ly6B<sup>hi</sup> macrophages in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> pulmonary cell suspensions compared to DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> control mice. The DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages as well as bone marrow monocytes are more easily recruited to LLC tumour-conditioned medium than DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> monocytes and macrophages, possibly explaining the higher number of monocyte/macrophages found in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> LLC-bearing lungs. Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> could also have been differentiated from tumour monocytes inflammatory pool, known to continuously seed tumors and renew all nonproliferating TAM subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref024">24</xref>]. To investigate this hypothesis, simunltaneous staining of cells with anti-LyC6 and anti- CX3CR1 need to be included in the staining panel as these cells have been shown to be Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>CX3CR1<sup>low</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>Proliferation assays, using CFSE labelling, performed on BMDMs stimulated with LLC-CM showed no difference between DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> BMDMs. This result excludes the idea that the higher number of macrophages found in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> lung homogenates could be due to higher macrophage proliferation and strengthens the involvement of cell migration. The enhanced recruitment of DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages is further confirmed by an <italic>in vitro</italic> migration assay. Hence, upon stimulation with LLC-conditioned medium, BMDMs and monocytes from DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice migrated faster than the ones from DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> mice. This was not the case when cells were stimulated with B16-conditioned medium. In addition, this difference was not observed for neutrophils. These results are in line with <italic>in vivo</italic> observations on B16 lung metastasis. Indeed, the percentage of macrophages was identical in B16-bearing lungs of DUSP3<sup>+/+</sup> and DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice and the percentage of Ly6B<sup>hi</sup> macrophages was equal if not lower in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to control mice. This further proves that there is a higher infiltration of macrophages in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice after LLC i.v. injection and that they are responsible for the enhanced lung metastasis formation. In fact, although these macrophages did not influence <italic>in vitro</italic> LLC proliferation or migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0185786.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), they may be responsible for the enhanced <italic>in vivo</italic> LLC proliferation as judged by the significant increase of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells in DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> lungs bearing tumours compared to the control lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0185786.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Several studies have indeed demonstrated that the density of TAMs positively correlates with tumor growth and is associated with a poor prognosis. The mechanisms involved are poorly understood but several studies have shown that TAMs secrete several factors, such as IL10, TGF-β, Arg1, CCL-17, CCL22 and galectin-3 that contribute to immunosupresion. Furthermore, TAMs could also activate and protect tumor stem cells, stimulate their proliferation, promote angiogenesis and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref018">18</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref019">19</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref025">25</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>One explanation for the higher recruitment of macrophages under LLC but not B16 influence would be that the profiles of cytokines and chemokines secreted by LLC or B16 differ. For example, tumour cells are the major source of CCL2 in Lewis lung carcinomas while B16 cells express low level of CCL2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref036">36</xref>]. Cytokines that are strong monocyte/macrophage chemottractants such as CSF-1, TGF-β or CCL7 may thus also be differentially expressed between these two cell lines, which may explain the differential recruitment of macrophages to the metastatic site of LLC and B16 cells. It is likely that one cytokine or the combination of some cytokines secreted by LLC and not B16 may favour the recruitment of DUSP3<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages that could explain the differential recruitment of macrophages to the metastatic site of LLC versus B16 cells. Consequently, it will be interesting to further investigate the precise signalling pathway implicating DUSP3 in the enhanced LLC tumour cell dissemination to lung tissues and the exact molecular role of DUSP3 in this event.</p>
<p>In line with our findings, a recent study showed that in NSCLC system, DUSP3 overexpression were associated with reduced cell migration and vis versa. The authors of this study also showed that DUSP3 interacts with FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and demonstrated that the negative correlation between cell migration and DUSP3 expression was at least partially due to its inhibitory effect on FAK and to suppression of EGFR whish is involved in cell chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref037">37</xref>]. Such mechanisms have to be investigated in our model.</p>
<p>Another intriguing role of DUSP3 is its function as a pro-angiogenic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref014">14</xref>]. Since angiogenesis has been regarded as essential for tumour growth and metastasis, our presented results seem contradictory to our previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref014">14</xref>]. However, studies of many human tumours suggest that tumours can grow and metastasize without angiogenesis. Indeed, several reports showed evidence for tumour resistance and adaptation to anti-angiogenic therapy leading to more metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref039">39</xref>]. Moreover, low doses of angiogenesis inhibitors resulted in vessel normalization, well oxygenated tumours and increased effectiveness of chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref040">40</xref>]. On the other hand, growing evidences indicate that tumour cells may use alternative mechanisms for blood supply. For example, vessel co-option, a procedure of hijacking the blood vessels in surrounding normal tissue, was reported in vascularized tissues such as brain, lung, and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref041">41</xref>]. Vessel co-option may occur in tumours independently of sprouting angiogenesis and there is increasing evidence supporting the use of this alternative blood supply in metastasis and resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0185786.ref043">43</xref>]. Although the impact of vessel co-option in our model is still to be demonstrated, we can assume that metastasis in our tumour model is not dependent on angiogenesis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this study, we provide evidences for an unexpected role of DUSP3 in cancer metastasis. In DUSP3-deficient mice, the enhanced LLC-lung metastasis involves a better recruitment/migration of macrophages, which in turn, favour metastasis growth. In conclusion, we show that DUSP3 acts as an anti-metastatic agent by regulating the migration monocytes/macrophages to the site of metastasis.</p>
